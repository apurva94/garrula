The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
She's not a...
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Neat...
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
He was, like, a total babe
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Wear the belly before you go.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
Get out!
Why not?
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
What's the worst?
Yeah
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You think this'll work?
Have you seen him?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Excuse me?
Kat! Wake up!
I should do this.
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
Then you screwed up
Tell me something true.
Answer the question, Patrick
Wait I...
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
You think?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
I could be gone for years.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
I have to explore the mainland.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You come!  You speak first!
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Esdras is a Jew.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
What are you saying?
The ocean is uncrossable?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What's he doing?
You bloody...
... Into a monk...
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Now I become custody of police department?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
I'm gonna propose.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Hey, honey.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
So what's unique?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tell him to put his gun down!
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Viewer discretion advised!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Mouth's clean, too.
What??
What?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

Okay. 
Really.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
How?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess not.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
You're in a hurry.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Yeah?
You're crazy.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
Let's go.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
What?
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
We missed.
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Which one pulled the trigger?
That's what you say, Cates...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
A cop...
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
Hey, you're right.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Whaddya think?
Three more hours...
Who the hell are you?
How ya doin'?
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
...Hello?
Other than that... You all right?
30 seconds...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Six to the left. One to the right.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Uh...
You noticed..
I'm so very sad.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Why?... Why would you need me?
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Have you identified it?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Drink!
Okay, I believe you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Hello?
You should have.
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
That's five thousand dollars.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
You brought the money?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Yeah, who's this?
Don't ask questions.
I want his name.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
You are a private investigator?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
He's lying.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
How long you been working there?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
How old are you?
What about me?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm not positive this means anything.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
Do you think the police did a good job?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Do you know what happened to her?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Kristen, what happened?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Enough of that crap.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
What do you mean?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Dad!
How was the meeting?
You disappointed in me?
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Then get out!
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
Reef!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Is there any way out of it?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Now they feel it...down below.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
All ready?
What do you think?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Why?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
See what?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Who?
No.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
You heard the news.
We bought you.
Guaranteed, eh?
You might not kill it.
Don't mind if I do.
You stayed away?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Open the door, will ya?
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
You? Why?
The key, Wade.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Then... I guess you have to.
You've been married twice --
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
Who are you?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Well, it was an accident.
The night before the shooting.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
What about Margie?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Got it.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
But they start executing hostages in
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
We've already been inspected.
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Leave my daughter alone.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Finally, we can bargain.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
You know what?
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I don't know why you stayed.
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
and if that means negotiating...
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
Shepherd.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
What's the story?
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
What are you doing, Ted?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Can I hold him?
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You've been hurt.
No.  I mean your relationship.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Both pilots!
Captain, how soon can we land?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
How ya doing, honey?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Hi!
Yes?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Do you feel all right, sir?
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I like my horizons narrow.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
He didn't recognize me.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Let's talk Hubley.
Nothing?
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Back off, George.
You know that guy?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Uh, George...
No!  We must do this alone.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Yeah, Sykes?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
You got your vest?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
Yes, Hicks?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Well you're not reading it right!
They're in the approach corridor.
It's game time.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Sounds like you, Hicks.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Yes.  A little girl.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Can we dream?
Maestro.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Oh - excuse me!
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Stop it!
That's stupid.
No!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What are you doing here?
How much will you pay him?
I see that you're expecting.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Hey!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
A-flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Majesty!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
It couldn't be better.
No, really!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
No.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
You flatter me.
What happened? Is it over?
Who?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Strange!
The Fire.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
And that's all?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Do you have it?
I am so ashamed.
Oh? Have I seen it?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
About what?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
But not his body.
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
That lady is back, sir.
But he's all right?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Go about your duties.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
Surely you're not suggesting...
What shall we do?
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
I was. What are you reading?
Do you like it?
Yes, go on.
I'm a werewolf.
The kitchen.
Anything.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Hello, Benjamin.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Lunatic?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Jack.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Okay.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Right.
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Shut up, you zombie!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Sorry.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where's Matt?
He has?
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that—
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
know, but—
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Yes?
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Got my letter?
Mr. Dickson?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
It's all right. Thanks.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Absolutely.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
He's at a board meeting.
Yes.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
What time did you get in?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Where's Charlie?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
This is the best score yet.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I ain't done --
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Beg pardon?
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
A bad idea.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Well?
What the --
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Jesse.
What?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Then why can't I go in there?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
You know him?
How'd it go in there?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
You've killed your fair share of men.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
That he was.
Ma! Please!
Doc Mimms will --
Jesse, are you awake?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Little ones.
Yep.
Zee.
We're moving you tomorrow.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Now let's have a drink.
You okay, Jesse?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Why, yeah.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
This is him.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
So he's won.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Yes?
I can't.
You like it there, don't you?
J&B. Straight.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Why?
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
Why? What's wrong?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
You're really serious, aren't you?
You're inhuman.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Because he dated her.
Doesn't he live here?
I think you should go now.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Dorsia.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh, something. . romantic?
You don't like this, I take it?
Patrick?
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Well...
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Nice. Very nice.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
Listen, what's your name?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
...But?
That took some fun out of --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What!
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
...What?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
You're interfaced with our dish.
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Who's that?
Had you talked to him much lately?
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Gary, I --
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
What've you got there?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
I snuck into #21.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Who can we trust?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Please don't go.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
What is it?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Who're these guys?
You seem surprised to see me.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
To my health.
Yes.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Hungry.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Be careful.
She's working on another lead right now.
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Why did you leave so soon?
I don't get it.
I hate having my picture taken.
Oh, yes you are.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Don't mind if I do.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Right.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Hi.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Umm, that also has already happened.
How's Austin?
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
Really?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
How long have I been here?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Then you can't come in.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Of course. I planned that, too.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
I thought we were on our way.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
That's what we were working on.
Steed ... !
Was I?
Aren't you coming?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Mrs. Peel?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Where's Mother?
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
No, please! I beg you ...
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
That's what we're going to find out...
Man, you're losing your audience.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
All right!
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Cole...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Fine. How's everything going?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Hookers beat you up?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
What the hell are you doing?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Oops!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Feel free.
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Where'd she go?
I'm not really hungry.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Right in there, pal.
How'd it go?
How 'bout this?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You're late again, Rick.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
You gotta let me finish --
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Been ripping off fire stations?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
You okay?
...Not now, Brian.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
How do you know?
Brian.
You're back.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Thanks for the invite.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Hi.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
I'm sorry.
What'll you do?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Then who wrote the report?
Did you pull me out?
Brian?
Aren't you even curious?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Firehouse.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
-- Burn them.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
What's to believe?
People.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Yeah, him.
I'm not smiling.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
This has to be a big mistake.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How was it?
Nobody told me anything.
Manray!
Hello.
This is the group I was telling you about.
You've said that already.
We both lied to him.
For what?
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
How so?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
So they can be on TV.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
He wants you to come and see him.
Finland.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...not that time...
I slept too near where I fell out.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You leave something out?
And?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Aw, c'mon.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Both of us ride home with Best here.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Have you taken my message to him?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I'll match any man with the sword.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
You want my heart?
To make me wretched in two weeks.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
By name only.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
He loves me, as I love you.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Did -- did you --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Yeah, right...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
What business?
Where?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Back up.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Full clip to the body --
I... I don't know...
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
How do you know?
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Stay where you are.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Ah, Christ
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Baseball?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
What is that?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Something wrong?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Why do you care?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
I pushed him too hard.
Think it'll work?
For what?
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
West?
Your phone number?
Pike, please --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
But you didn't see it, right?
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
What do you think?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
See! The big guy likes it.
Someone stole my backpack.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Bloom like a flower?
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Spooning the sherbet.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
You don't like it?
What did she say?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You owe me three-fifty.
I thought you weren't dying.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Oh. Oh.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
You never told me how your parents met.
How is he?
Was she one of your teachers?
Mom?
You know what for.
It's enough isn't it?
What? What are you doing?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
Sorry. You've lost me...
Yes. I know.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
No.
You must have a visa or something...
When?
Do you believe in love?
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants a lot of money.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Today is bath day.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
What?
So uh...
Oh Jesus.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't hate you.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
I wasn't saying anything.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Nobody's that unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Goodbye.
Whatever.
No. What? No. I know.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
I bet you have loyal customers.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Better?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Where's Ronnie?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Tell me what to do.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Shit. Who hasn't?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I feel better. Do you?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
What happened to your face?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Frank Abolofia.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick... You up?
Let's go.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Joyce can be nice.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Nick!
Why the hell not?
What happened?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
I've continued working on the case!
Did I say that?
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
It's illegal, Nick.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Joyce?
You all right?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
And I'm supposed to care?
Where's the wife?
They want your autograph.
You'll get Ich killed.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
She's such a long way home for you.
How big a package we talking about?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
We're police officers.
Could you fill me in?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
You trust me?
If I say no?
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
One man.  He must be good.
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
What, Sebastian?
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Six, huh?
Industrial refuse.
Yeah.
How do I stop one?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Thank you very much.
Those cockroaches?
I like you.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Taffey Lewis?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Book the good ones for where?
Yeah?
It's artificial?
In your opinion.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Who is this?
How come you're not on the job?
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
They could clean around the arrangement.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Uh-huh.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Where the hell you been?
May I ask a personal question?
Well?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
How do you do?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Do you own a car?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait!  Wait!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
I can't, it's yours.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Why not go to work for me?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
What's fair?
Who are these people?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Thank you.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
Get out!
Now, get out!!
I was wrong!!
He has a computer?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
No it's not!
No!  Not crazy!
I like her.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
You wanted to see me!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I don't blame you!
Eve?!
I know first aid!
Hi, Eve!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
Like a painting?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
But, I don't understand.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Who use to own it?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Why did you park way back there?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Bye, Troy!
You dial nine to get out.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
I don't see anything!
Whatcha looking at?
Say what?!
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Elbows, Son.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
No.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
All back East.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Well, put it down and come in!
Days??
What's that noise?
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
I've noticed.
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Should we say a little prayer first?
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
You came back for these?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Well, what do you think?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Go to the bathroom.
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I don't think so.
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
Yeah! That's thinking.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Tower, say again!!
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
To your health, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Don't say that.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Look.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
Frank gone?
Bull.
Where are we going, Frank?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Hello?
I don't want to go.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Yeah?
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
Nothing. I'm fine.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Good to see you, son.
Oh yeah?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
That sounds good.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
OK.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey? Why?
What was that all about?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
There's ways around that.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
They got nothing.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
No ma! No!
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Hey Murphy?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
She was in here when it went down.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
What?
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
A couple of peons for the mob and...
What the...?
Promise me boys.
Roc. You okay?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Yes.
Forgive me father.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Don't do this my son.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Just be natural, goddamit.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
It had an alarm.
What's wrong with him?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Yes, they are.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, now we've got a plan.
He went back for his brother.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I wish I'd been there.
I have an idea for that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
We've got sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
I want you to look at this.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
Do you like Inez?
You're all clear.
We all set?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
Where's Kumar?
What?
You're living on a sailboat?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
You mean like techniques?
This is good.
Are you serious?
See you.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
OK, Bob.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
What are you doing?
What happened?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Not in that car you're not.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Dignan.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Scarecrow?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Ground defense.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he good?
Why?
What's the story?
We're closed, sir.
You like Chicanos?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Let's talk about Conklin.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Berlin!
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Why not? It was just money.
Had to be done.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- it hasn't been two years --
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
So...
You drive.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I know it's a dream.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
So when was I here?
It's me.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Still...
Amnesia?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Does anyone know his politics?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Rest, William.
You know it's a trap.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You'll move
Where is my son?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I am the Princess of Wales.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
We can't stop!
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Why? What for?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
No.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I don't know... I don't remember.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
What does that mean for Evan?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Dad lives here?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Are you hurting her?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Can... can... Can I have this?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Just get out, didja?
Meant no offense.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
You want my advice?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Yes, I come.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Do you know where they are?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
Not an easy day to forget.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Please.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
What happened with Rick?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And I congratulate you.
Good morning.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I beg your pardon?
Well, this might come in handy.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes.
I understand.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No, Captain, please.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Even in Berlin.
You will give us the names?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Victor Laszlo.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Oh, it's my party.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Will I see you tonight?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Hello?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss, let's get out of here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Thirsty.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too little you'll die.
No more water, you said.
No.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
I love you, Chuck.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
I am one lucky guy.
Need some help?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
You're Chuck Noland.
What happened to your pants?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Kamal is not here.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Hello?
You're fucking dead!
Cool ropes.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
To Wilson.
What, then?
What'd she die of?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I've never seen a lobster.
Where's Mandalay?
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
A movie *outside*?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
*What* will be okay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
You don't understand! It's her father...
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
I just wanted to ask you...
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
There was no visible wound?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Where's the name sheet?
Rose Rose?
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
That's *it*?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Where do you think you're going?
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
This has to happen fast.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Ten percent. Of how much?
The Anti-Christ?
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
You're a superstitious fucker.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
So we go to the bar.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Whoa. What?
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Shit.
How much we going after?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Calls?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Stake you?
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Oh Jesus!
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
He's gone.
You told me to change my hair!
Look at you... You want to go.
Do you have something to prove?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
How do you know I will?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Meet me at my place later.
We're working for the King.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Pretty much.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Speak.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
I'm Bella.
Not like Matt, you mean.
How about fifteen hundred?
Eight-fifty.
All right. As what?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
You're shaking. What is it?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Really?
Why did you take the money?
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Oh hello.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
He doesn't gamble.
I owe a lot of money.
The point is, they want a man inside.
But if it does.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I'm sorry.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Jani! Where are you?
How are you?
You've been avoiding me.
I'm Lucy.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Where did you go to school?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Where's the magnet?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Thanks for the information.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
What the hell?
Rechannel all safety relays --
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
This is fun.
That's it.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
In a second.
What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
You know what I think about, Talby?
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What's that, sir?
Negative effect.
Sir?
Sir?
Who are you?
Oh, yeah?
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What a creep.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
What else can we do?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Is the social studies class over for today?
How do I know you didn't?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I'm sorry.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
As long as you're okay.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Yeah.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Please...
So are dogs.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
True, but--
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I-I c-can't...
Jeremiah?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Sunday, but...
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Uh... dudes?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
I got...
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Oh, hi, mom.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
What?!
Mom, what're we...?
Well? Continue! Continue!
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
I feel bad for his family.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
What happened to your eye?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Where are we going?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Will you please talk to me?
Did you call the cops?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Nothing.
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
People get hurt.
Regret.
Then how is time travel possible?
Why would I tell Mom?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Our son just called me a bitch.
Excuse me?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Kitty...
There's no rule!
What is this shit?
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Is Mom okay?
You're what?!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
You-betcha.
What is wrong with you?
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
I'm gonna need more caps.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh shit!
Go on! Get out!
C'mere. I love you so much.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Lester?
That's enough!
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
What!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
I will if you shut your piehole.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Half watch dog?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
It must be done right away.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Are you getting tired?
That's even a greater honor.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
John loves the house.
You stay with me.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
I want my man back.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Good day...!
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
How awful for John.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
My... name is...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
...Yes potatoes... but...
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
The Children. Where are your children
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
You did this for me?
My home.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
Right! Where is he?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
Please! Please! What are those?
What was she like?
You're as bad as my father.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
But you don't realize....
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
How do we know this is the way?
Is there nothing men can do?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No. 
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Scream.
Louder.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
"But" what?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
That's terrible!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
What?
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
What did he say?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You mean we'd be dead?
Wait, Erik!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye, Leif.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
Vanish into thin air?
Are you all right?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
My brother blacksmiths!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Made by YOU, Loki!
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well... I'm game.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And you've got BOTH axes?
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
I remember.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
May I help you?
Come over after I'm done here?
You rat.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Rockville Center.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I like it.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
You're sure? It's cold.
It's okay.
Where do you live?
So you like bookstores, huh?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Frost?
You just say. I'm not really --
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
What?!
I want to know you.
Oh?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
Yeah.
You said...
You know what I did.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I just got in.
Clementine.
So then she just stops calling.
She's so sexy.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
What?
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I'm sorry.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
No way. I can handle this.
What's this?
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
What, Howard?
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Tell me about it.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
What do you think?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Whose fault was that?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Going north?
Hitchhiking?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Time to play Spam in the can.
From what?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
How is he?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
What is it?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Patch me through to him.
...I don't want to die...!
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
We've got pressure.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Can anybody hear me...
Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
You can't have them. Go to hell.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
You've got to listen...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Miller, come in...
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Claire is your wife?
What are you doing?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I mean...
What are you doing here?
Ben, come in.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
What about his first born?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What the --!
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
It's about to be a broken face.
What's wrong with me?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Back it down, Johnny!
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
You're really cramping my style here.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
They're ready for you, sir.
Feeling better?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
What are you doing?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Ben's still out there --
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this?
It's just business.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Any problems?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Pick a suit.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
Hey, Mike?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Hey, Rat.
Poor guy.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
My brother is gonna shit.
That's him! He did it!
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Does that ever happen?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Not coming? What happened?
Sometime?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
What's that?
If you graduate.
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Where's Mike today?
What's April 16th?
I made a fool of myself.
Are you ready to order here?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
He wanted the pineal gland.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Jesus creeping shit!
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I have to go.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I want that fucking radio!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
The cops?
NO! Stop talking like that.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Could I have that, please?
What?
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We should go! We should go right now!
Where are you two going?
I don't think you should...
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Oh!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Scared?
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
How much you got?
My husband...
Huh?
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What's going on between you two?
What's it for!?
What?!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Hurry!
OH JESUS!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Let's move.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
DON'T!
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Go! Go!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Hello, Harold.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Get your clothes on, lady --
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
...Don't you?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
But, Kurt, I...
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Oh no...
Jesus.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Don't start, Farmer.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
What for?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
I don't know.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Pretty morning.
Yeah.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
I live here.
What?
That's me, Clifford.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
I think I need a little air.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Yes...?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
...Did you really say that?
Is there something else?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
You what?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Kill you? Hardly that.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
What kind of God is He to will this?
Father's so proud.
I've loved you all my life
I wish to be your wife.
Our decision. Together.
I give you my soul...
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
It's going to ram us.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
No. But someday.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Do you really think I'm mad?
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
You're making a scene!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Paracelsus?
Ah. An explorer.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Oh, my God...
How come you're leaving?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It sounded like Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
You know what I said, though.
Somebody's there, Barry.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Ow!
It's gonna be a long summer.
I love you.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
It's beautiful...
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Good luck.
What was that?
You like the car?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Why'd ya quit?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Did he...?
What's this stuff?
What?
What did I say?
Creepy guy.
I'm sorry.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Not even for lunch?
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
What dya mean?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Gotcha!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
How's it feel?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Keep your voice down.
You okay?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
You could take their head off.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Got it.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
See me, sir?
Permission to leave, sir?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Can't complain, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You don't know that.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
O'Neil?
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Chances of recovery?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Jordan...
So why are you telling me this?
No shortage of suspects.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Got it.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Clear.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
What?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
My God. He's going after the nest.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Are you okay?
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Mr. Caiman...
Not for a long time, now.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need you to trust me.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
This is it?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Don't speak, Quellek.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Go ahead!
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Settle down, Alex...
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
A boy comes to the door.
We heard it the first time!
"Go into the cloud! ...
I don't know.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
... Yes?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
What do you mean?
How did you come to that conclusion?
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
What's the weather like outside?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
...The digital conveyor.
Where are the miners?
...Okay
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Hi everybody.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
What?  What did he say?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
That's it, It's go time.
I heard it too.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
We pretend...
A model, only as big as this.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil...
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Partially...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
No, please; an advance on your salary.
These supplies...?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
You're out of your mind!
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Who?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
What's this movie you're doing first?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
She's... young.
Where's Karen?
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
I'm working on a few things.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
The airport.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Why would I do that?
Sovereign.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You're an investor, is that it?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Something shouldn't be there.
That's what I'm doing.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You okay?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Hello, Doris.
What's wrong?
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry -–
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
But you are interested?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
What is your first name?
Maureen.
Maureen.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Maybe that is his boat.
Smokes?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
How long, then?
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
The radio!
You're late.
Morning everybody.
You mean, before she sank.
You okay?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
What'd you find up there?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
How's he doing?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
It's not gonna hold us.
What do you think happened on this boat?
The what?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What do you think?
They went crazy.
What happened?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Let the buyer beware.
Yeah.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
What now?
I don't know.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
It's a Noaa buoy.
I thought you say Tuesday.
What's this?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Are you still looking for a job?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Did you actually do this painting?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
It's not optional!
That guy rules!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Yeah, right.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Yeah, right...
When did I say I hated you?
Hi Enid.
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
What? Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
I might actually get the pasta special.
You can have that one.
You're better at it.
I want to "make love" to him.
What's he doing now?
Are you sure?
This is way too creepy.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What was that all about?
Ew ... when did you get that?
It's a surprise.
Give me all your money, bitch!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
That rules!
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
He gives me a total boner!
You're just jealous.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
No, really...
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
A what?
Who does?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
...are you waiting for a bus?
Fine, and how are you?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
Really? Can I see it?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I - I'd really rather not...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
So, why did you bring this along?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What is that?
Aren't you going to get that?
Oh, hi...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well when can we do something?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
What's up?
What's the matter?
Where did you get this?
I'm just being realistic.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
No... forget it...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
No... they said she was here...
Why would she be hiding from me?
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Starting now, we attack them.
Pleasant journey?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
That's a terrible idea-
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
Second death? Where?-
Got me out of trouble.
Actually, no.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Have you got it?
Think about something else.
I'll be bait alone?
I'll have to.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Good luck.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Soon. 
You've known him long?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Janosz?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
What do you think?
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Well, good night, Louis.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
These boys aren't playing around.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Rivers of the stuff!
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
I'm Ray --
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
Like a goat on garbage.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
She's moving!
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
Now where are you going?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Who's the stiff?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
You must have gotten the last copy.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Can I help you?
All right.  What is it?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Sorry, Buddy!
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
How was your date?
They will.
Ray -- Something's here.
Who was the architect?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Do you believe in God?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Where have you been?
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Give away food?
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
You cannot die.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
As soon as I can.
What the hell was all that about?
Serious stuff...
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
What about their philosophy lessons?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Then get a large cash advance.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you want some dinner?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Is anything wrong?
Where we going?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Did they ever find out?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
I want to ask you a question.
I said I think it is.
Why?
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
What are you looking for?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Carl who?
Why do you have to see him?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
Exactly how do you mean?
You a student?
What are you then?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Hello.
Where are you?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is it a girl?
In general.
Thank you.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
Then why do you keep running away?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Benjamin?
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
How are you?
May I have a drink?
He didn't see me.
Why don't you get it.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Thank you.
You what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
That you're afraid --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Do you really want me to?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
How do you get out of the house?
Right.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
I wish you'd tell me.
Do you understand that?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
What?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
No -- actually I'm not --
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Why did you say that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I don't know. I want it to be --
Why?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Yes?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
What's happening?
Turn 'em up.
It's a short life and a gay one...
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Need any help?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I don't like your tone.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I'll pay you back.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
We'll dance.
Going?
Oh!
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
And -- and --
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
That's a silly joke.
There.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I'll go -- good-bye.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
Why?
Till then.
Then you know him?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
The Baron is tired?
What?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Is that for me?
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Any letters?
Oh -- but -- I --
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
You dance splendidly.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
You're a little too fast.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Oh, no.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Shall I tell them again?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Four minutes past. Please come.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Your what?
Motherhood.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
All right.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Perk, remember?
So what's your story today?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
For God's sake, Lilly!
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Let me see how you did that one.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Get well soon.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
The tap. What you do for a living.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Think about it. Okay?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You were gone for a while.
That's what I say.
What's that?
I realize this is a shock.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Carter.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Funny, we just drove right in.
A dead body?
My god...
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
No.  Wait for the police.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
He found you, didn't he?
Not me.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
The serial killer?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Keri, you all right?
You aced it, didn't you?
Better her than me.
Ooooh, busted.
Thanks!
He do that to you?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What is it this time?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Where's the baby?!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
Can I have the Cadillac?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
What's funny about that?
Huh.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
I know you think that.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Sir?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Can I help you, sir?
Sir?
You don't even know me.
What's the matter?
Your old beau?
Now that's what I call fun.
I have some change!
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
It couldn't!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
The doctor.
I came for Paul as well.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Two hundred years old.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
He's a child!
No you don't.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
No.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I mean it!
How do I load?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
You have chills?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
What brought you back?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You're too modest.
What is this thing that kills me?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Dead!
How horrible.
So long, you guys.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
No.
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Where will you be?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
I don't get it.
What does he say to do?
Really?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
It's fine!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He isn't?
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
What was it?
I'm saying no--and thank you.
You were wonderful.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The what?
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You know each other?
Do it!
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
No.
No, I don't.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
We offer...
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Are you sure it's all right?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
And your wife? Where's she?
You know what I'm talking about.
Say what?
No.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Why do you say that?
Granville?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
Hello?
Mast?
I don't know.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
The police? They know less than you do.
Yeah. Probably.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What happened, pilgrim?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
Hey man.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
I don't know.
Who told you about this?
Take it or leave it.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Fifty cents admission.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Was he with a girl?
You are at the University, Candy?
And what are you studying?
Yes.
Your tree.
Haven't we met before?
Officer, I can explain.
How interesting.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Yes.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
What do you think?
You look as if you could.
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Why do you say that?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
No.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Did Confucius say that?
You are the wisest person I know.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
With God?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Oh.
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
How about some candy floss?
Do you think there is any life up there?
Why?
I feel giddy.
Mother.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
How do you do?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
And why is that?
Fifteen.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Your studies?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Why?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
That's right.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I've got to finish it.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
He talked about Demons, huh?
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Son. About Rasputin --
I worry about you.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
That voice --
She's dead.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
You're kidding --
Where do you --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
You're going alone?
Strong.
You fucking ass-holes.
It's my lucky day.
Will you sign for the bed?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Let me alone, will you?
Just in time.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
Frank --
You're Julia, right?
But you said --
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I'm hurting
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
You would be. They tore me apart.
She'll tell them everything...
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
Larry!
Where are you?
Julia?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Maybe a brandy.
Is this upsetting you?
Larry...
Oh baby.
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
Kirsty?
Where are you?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Take care, Dad.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Get the fuck out of here.
We're on the Cointreau.
I'm here.
You know I do know the way home.
What do we do if there isn't?
It's not what I heard.
I've been better.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Not the point.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
What did he ever do to you?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
The little skate-fuckers.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Hey, Barry.
Where's Rob?
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Is there a difference?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Good weekend?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I always hated this song.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Can I do anything?
What is this.
Can I help you?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
I dunno.
So shall we leave it at that then?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Alright, alright but --
What were the others?
Yeah.  Great.
Is it better?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Will you call me?
Hello.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Me?
You know, with Ray...
What about Ian?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Hi.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  Probably not.
Very persuasive.
So?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Hi, Mom.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
You're the expert.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Would you remember his name?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Who?
I'd rather hear yours.
He sees me as a threat.
No.
What's all that?
You make it all sound so simple.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Not the same.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I'm calling an attorney.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What were you doing in Felton?
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Afternoon.
You're not from these parts.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Not so scared.
You're wrong.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Do not turn your back on me.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Are you sure?
Where!
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
We have some unfinished business.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Do you know what this is?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
My condolences.
All I need is time.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Morning Mr. North
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
How do you mean?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I'll keep you in mind.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
But --
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Mr. Burns --
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Anything the matter?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
What's this?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
How long is what?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
What do you mean?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Never mind that. What's the story?
She jumped out of the window.
Where do you think you're going?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
How about Bruce's?
It'll be Heaven!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Anything you want, Boss.
Who do you want?
Sure, boss.
Walter!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
I don't know --
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Who locked the door?
Hey!
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
I'll call.
What a chase!
We know what you're up to.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
After all I've done for you --
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Just one second --
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Where's the old lady?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Kings and sixes.
Hiding him where?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
What's that?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
The door was locked.
What's that?
Can I try?
That was a googly!
Only till they get you into the local school.
You want to join our gang?
Do you know any swear words?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
You wouldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Who with?
I did see them. I did.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Crocodiles! Aah!
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
And Jim.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
We don't know anything about it
Well?
What are you going to be then?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
What did he say?
It was the best time of his life.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I wish it could all have been different.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I agree.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Who's your Daddy!
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Thank you.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
He walks, duh.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
You mean John Wayne?
But if you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Keep straight on this road here.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
Just grin and bear it.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Go around him.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Check this out.
Come on, get with the facts.
Is that all... think real hard.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Yeah?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Rise and shine.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
A couple hours!
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Oh, right.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Why? Why are you doing this?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Well hello, officer.
I don't know. I only saw one.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Wydell.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
What is wrong, my darling?
Fine.
My little French.
What is it?
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Well, I think...
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
My apologies, madam.
You what?
That's what I'm counting on.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
As do I.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
It looks wonderful.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Boy, this is good!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, and the sun block?
Come on.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Really?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
So he's doing okay?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Ugnh.
No, why?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Huh?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
And a fact is a fact.
I want to talk to you.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You bastard.
I'll make it up to you.
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
We'll be there.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Poker's not your game.
Character.
That's your problem.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
I never saw you do anything else.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Fine.
What's the matter? What happened?
Sure.
How do we stand?
They're fine.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Whaddya mean?
Quit. He's too good.
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Yeah, that's what I think.
Findley.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Yeah. You must come again.
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
You quittin' too?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
Have a nice trip.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
What time is it?
You got it all in your head?
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Give it to me.
Who is it?
He knows. A lot.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You need the words?
Well, what's so funny?
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Is that a fact?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Your shot.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Do you remember where you lived?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You want to find them.
Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Only got one kind.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Is that all he said?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
They'll get us.
No one comes here after dark.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
I have school.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
What do you want?
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
Are you all right?
I don't know how you put up with him.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What're you talking about?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You still got the Olds?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Not listed, huh?
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
That's impossible...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
With their shields down it might be possible.
Really? You don't mind?
Your son.
Was his father stationed here?
Really? Ballet?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Stevie... I can't...
I don't need it.
But I gave you some this morning.
What the hell's going on?
Call them back.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Ah, Venice...
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Tapestries?
Where did this come from?
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Doctor Jones?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Bingo.
It must be one of these...
I said go around!
This.
What are you going to do?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
But what are you doing here?
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Well, what was left of him.
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
I ought to tell you something.
And the chair.
Dad!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
Ready?
I don't need camels.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Who?
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
You got the tickets, Short Round?
I ride with you, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Give me the stones!
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
India...
Took what?
What'd he say now?
Indy! Help me!
A what...?
What?!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
What about the future?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
WILLIE?!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Al.
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Do me a favor, Al.
Somebody's been here.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Yeah...Who?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
What are you doing?
Anyone there?
Now what?
What do you mean we.
I did. I brought you back here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Just walk down the hall?
Like the guys that attacked us.
That's not a good idea.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
What is it?
What do we do?
I can't do that.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach?
Do you notice anything.
Beautiful!
She's...pretty fast.
She doesn't seem to understand.
What do I do?
What?
Where are you going?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
But what's it look like?
You really like that shirt?
Mind your own business.
Not that tie with that coat.
Which one?
They're all in it.
What is it, your charm?
It's embarrassing.
You got any books in there?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Do it.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Awwww...
You just got a Mickey.
No!
What happened?
Impossible.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Me.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
I don't want to intrude.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
The fresh tuna?..
Dinner...tonight.
What's so funny?
Wait. What's your name?
Promise you what?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
And how'm I doing?
Joe! What happened to you?
What did you tell them?
Were you working for him last night?
Then why are you smiling like that?
And you?
How?
What?
So do I.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What a mess.
What?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Don't worry.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Riuji?
He wants to apologise.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
Excuse me?
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Ow?...
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Hi, honey.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
P.J.'s.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Debbie...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Hello?
Lowell?
Right now?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Thank you, Bob.
Yeah.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Will independent sources corroborate that?
What's wrong?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
We're there.
No shit.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
I disappeared on you?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
I know what I have to know.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Jeff...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
You attract a crowd.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
I told the truth!
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You try and have a good time.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Baby. You are so HOT!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
I don't need it.
It was a gift from a client.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
I'm happy for you, pal.
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Is Tong older than Ming?
How nice.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Oh, for the love of...
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
And here I thought my mother was...
I want to be your -- your wife.
You do?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I don't have a ring!
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Hi.
You don't like me?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I don't believe you have "things."
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
It's a no go, Joe.
You were going to have this thug...?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Murder!
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
What?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Mr. Massey --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
And it's good!
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Ah.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
What's Kirshner?
And she has...?
Extinguish?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Who said anything about a reward!
I might.
You ought to know why. Because—
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Well!
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Peter Warne! 
Why should she? After all—
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
You talk as if—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What would you like to have me do?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
I beg your pardon!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here—
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
King—King Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Peter—
What!
Thought you were hungry!
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
What'd you give him for the car?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
I'm hungry.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Joe, listen—
What's the thousand bucks for?
What!
Huh?
If it's on the level.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Send it collect.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Mebbe.
Then—you'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Did he pay you for this?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
But why?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Why?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Who was paying you, Dave?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
No.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Are we going away, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
And if you're wrong?
For sexual purposes?
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
Well, thanks for coming.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
It never did. 
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
How many men are working with you on this?
Can I help you?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I understand.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What'd ya mean?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's going on?
What's she willing to give us?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
How was your flight?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
That doesn't sound dark.
You gain weight?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
What did they want to know?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
You get a chance to use it?
What, I couldn't hear you?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
It's different with men.
"American President"
How old's Annette?
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
I called you last night.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
What if he checks it?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
Wanna go?
I thought you were tired of your business?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
What if I plead guilty?
Most of the times.
He say is a surprise.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
We can look into that.
You know what we want.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Not really.
You didn't count it?
That would be one point of view.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
Where's the bag she gave you?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Sure.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
It looks good on you.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
What the hell you doin'?
I got a problem...
Yeah.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
That's the idea.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
How long?
What for?
You're fourteen years old here?
With Ordell?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I lived there for about nine months.
About five years ago.
Is it dead?
Please.
I'm carrying it.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Who was that?
How much is there?
She believed you?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
How long was she in there?
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
It's in my bag.
Who's it for? A relative?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
I need your name and address.
House or apartment?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
I can see that. Why?
It still sounds high.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
How the fuck did he find me?
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Get me out of here.
Remember?
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
You have an unusual hand.
What are you talking about?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I am.
I'm too messed up to teach.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
You think they're connected?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She hates me, Louis.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Ah!
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
They stole it.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
I moved the couch. That's all.
The room!
What happened to you?
You up?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Yeah, but for what?
What do you mean you can see?
Ready?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
We're at Della's.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
While you were in the shower.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
How?
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
What's going on?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Jake, what is it?
You can have anything you want.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Goddamn you!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Dream on!
He's burning up.
I'll page him.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Speaking.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Can I help you?
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
He's not part of the program.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Goodbye old friend.
Uh-oh.
Nice touch.
Hey! I'm not ready.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
We'd need charges.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Jesus, God!
Kicker, anything?
Pull me in!
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
It's time.
That's really funny.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
I'll help you in.
And what's with the headgear?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
This is what it means right here.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Robot huh?
Barbie from hell...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I didn't say I was good at it.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
It's just you and me, then.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Azrael can you repeat that?
What have you done?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
This is Matt Hooper...
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
What about us?
Right.
Probably out in the back yard.
Don't forget these.
Be careful.
Love ya.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Got a pen on you?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What? What?!
What is all this stuff?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
What day is this?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You know how I feel about her.
Hey Bleek.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Really? What are they like?
Jesus, Bleek.
I don't like Katrina.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
You know it's okay.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Can we make out now?
Just like our moms and teachers!
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
We don't even have a dog!
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Junk?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Uh, thanks.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Can I take your coats?
What...
Oh my God...
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Please stop now.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
You're not listening to me.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Aw, please Junebug?
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
You guys are playing music?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
...Pardon?
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Is it hard to learn?
I'm cool.
What's this?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Shush, Adele.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
What's your name, boy?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
So what do you do Early?
Henry Lucas.
That bad?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
So tell me... what happened here?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
What did he sound like on the phone?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
What is it?
What's that?
Carrie... stop it.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Bri'.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...never?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
What happened?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, how was it?
Oh man, that's the best.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
I hate this game.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Right.
Shut up.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Casper! Was up kid?
Sup. Sup.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You know what I want to do?
Why?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
You still mad at him?
You are being ripped open.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
And you don't get shit out of it.
Oh shit.
Yep.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
Not too late.
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Casual.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
What do you mean, no?
Are you crazy?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
The message!  I figured out--
What are you talking about?
What do you think?
No shit!
You still having a problem with this?
What is it?
Ready for round two?
We'll find the evidence.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
To get your attention.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Yes?
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Now what?
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
What scars?
Feeling better?
Has he gotten through to any?
What is it, dad?
You ready?
Any sign of rape?
Anything?
You mean, no prints but hers?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Did you see his face?
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
It wasn't intentional.
I think it's interesting.
I'm just curious.
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Did you call?
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
You beat him.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Me too.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Take the western passage.
Lyssa ...
The White Castle has fallen.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is nothing.
Can she be forced?
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She must make a glaive.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Slayers!
I road them often in my youth.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Once is enough, thank you.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
My <u>friend</u>.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
We meant only to please you.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He is the King.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Look.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Who speaks that name!
...Office 2702.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Rocket launcher.
Wow! It's brilliant!
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Poor darling, and then?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
You can't sit here like that.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
Here comes the resume.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
I have to finish first.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
The new store?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
No.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
I know where my heaven is.
To where?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
I'm walking there Kris.
Tom Joad?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
... My father.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
How are you feeling?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Hello!
Are you working?
You're pretty drunk.
Sarah -- with an H?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
I guess I do too.
Do you want to fuck now?
Don't run away.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
How long have I been here?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
What do you mean?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Thank you, Sera.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
You have been lonely?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
What alibi?
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I'll take that as a no.
Is he always such an ass?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
No!
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
What's going on?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
You're hitting on me?
What's going on?
I think so...
You can't even imagine.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Is she?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Good one.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
Too demure?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
You have Stromwell.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
Why?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Oh, my God!
Someone missed you.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I don't know --
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
I didn't mean --
Thanks for the backup.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Let's all go! Road trip!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Fire moat... why do that?
What?
We go out, smash 'em now?
You go to lady now?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You... you're a beast!
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Yes?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Fine-looking army.
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Good.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
What make ye of that, Jack?
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Easily spoken...
Water doesn't burn...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
But you did... you did!
Liar!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
What happened?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
I'm afraid it may storm.
I thought you were dead... I --
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Biting you?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
What's this now?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'd be honored.
In every way.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Please...
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
In a dream.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I put him to work.
Atonement.
Why?
What's today?
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
It's not what I was expecting.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Where's your dad?
I can't even take a shower here.
Huh?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I was wondering.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You'd hate him for the trick.
He won't leave my room.
Oh, yes.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I'm not going!
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
What are you doing?!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I hate turkey.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'm not even listening.
I know parts of who you are.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Are you talking?
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
I aimed high.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
God, you look like crap, George.
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I love those doors.
Hey, hey!
It makes me sad.
I used to live here.
It's not breakfast yet.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'm married.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I better get the kids home.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
I can't go right now.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Where are the kids?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
I've missed you guys.
Do you know anything about building a house?
The door was open.
All day again?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Sharp.
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Reward?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
What'd you say?
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
How you doin'?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Mama?
Lemonade?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Who?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
We could create our own hell there.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
And give you a good buzz.
I'll call her later.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Where did you meet my father?
How did you see me?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What's Nicky doing down there?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Makin' friends already.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're a good devil, Dad.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
You sure you're down with this?
Which way did he go?
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
..."The Devil?"...
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Hey...
I'm a Sandman!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Answer the question!
That's better.  How do you want us?
How do you want us?
What other food?
I am.
Had enough?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
That was a great shot you made.
What the hell took you so long?
Of course.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
When do you go up?
Sad? What made you sad?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
And now?
About what?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
Maybe... sure...
About running, dying what?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
And then you killed him, right?
I don't..
I wish I could help you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Don't ever let go.
...But I still have the choice...?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
And Sanctuary?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
What belongs to the people?
How long have you been living here?
What kind of place is this?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Well? How do you like it?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
You okay, man?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
I like to remember things my own way.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
What a fuckin' job.
I was here yesterday.
Okay...
Sure.
You like it?
You liked it.
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
You all right?
You killed him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
What night is that?
Hey.
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
Please tell me.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
That's not Fred Madison?
I want to see him.
Do you remember?
We know that.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house. Don't you remember?
What's that?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Good book, huh?
What's that? Another tape?
We will.
What was that?!!!
Where would you feel safe?
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Suit yourself, champ.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Last time I saw you.
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Sheila...
Sheila... Stop...
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Found in Asia!
Don't call me brother.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Yes.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Yes.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
There you are!
Think of it! In times like these.
Hey, what's happened to you?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Goodness, no!
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Who?
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
What do you want?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Oh, immediately.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Oh George, come on.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Porters?
George, come back!
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
What's she got to do with it?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
was saying—
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where did you come from?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Why, he's speaking English.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
You'll wait till you rot!
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
They don't?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
It'll make sense later?
I wasn't scared...
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
What's going on, Kay?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
What are you doing?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What are you doing?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Agatha --
The other two will die without me.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
She grew up.
John?  What is it?
And replace them with new ones.
Why?
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Hence the expression...
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
You can't run --
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
We can't grab it...
Somewhere near the capital?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Confirm with trig and image.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
Flaws.
She was looking right at me.
Just go to the beginning!
Are you reading my mind right now?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Stop --
Okay... now let me time you.
It's a little late for that.
You're alive?
But you have to.  They said you would.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Let go of the gun.
What's so funny?
What?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You said they're destroyed.
Where?
How do I even know which one has it?
I understand.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Lamar, I found something.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
What?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
There a maid in this hotel?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
John Anderton was my friend!
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Cream and sugar.
No.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
You know I need to use you.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
As far as...?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
It's on West Broadway.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
No coke tonight.  Right?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
I want you to quit.
Get your hands off of her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's up? Jess ready?
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Where we going?
That it?
You bet the ponies?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Yeah. Sure.
Yes.
You want --
A bad heart.
What's the plan?
No. Just the cross streets.
'Trustafarians?'
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Sorry, man, but...
So, it's not a winning record.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We need guns.
He implied it.
Sorry coach.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
So they said more than the address.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
He woulda told us right?
You fucking nuts?
What the hell did you do?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
We need guns.
Wanna bet?
Calm down.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
C'mon...
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
I want to leave right now.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Don't drag my ass into this --
Stop.
No, really, mate?
Here they are, then.
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
We're square.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Dip?
Where can I get a hold of you?
When?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
What you say?
Who the hell are you?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Where am I gonna start?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I will do it.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know how.
Do you?
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Make it plain.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
I see your point.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Just an idle question.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
It will be rough.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Brother Earl.
I assumed...
Just what are you saying?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
Get out.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
You're my father.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
They talked about me like
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
[Senor?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Where does he live?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Is it loaded?
And what if amateurs try it?
I'm here.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
You did something on impulse?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
What are you doing?
No.
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The blocks.
Could I ask you a question?
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Then be trained.
You're American.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Last night. Do you know something?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Bye, Mom.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Our child's safety is at stake.
He has to go, Samuel.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I could see she likes you.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who?
What they say?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You come up here often?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Marty...
No...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
What?
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
What?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
On accounta...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Yes, O'Reilly?
What are you going to do with him?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Where?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
You – must – open – me – up – again?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Ravenous. What about you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Is that liquor?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
How did you get called that?
Our minds?
Even if I weren't.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
Why can't you look at him?
What's wrong with him?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Who?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Can I help you pack?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
How much money do you get?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Say that again.
You made it up.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
I can read. I can read!
Looks all right—
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Has he been here?
Where's Connell?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Ba-ll!
St-rike!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I don't get it.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
What's your name?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Yes! I was paid! But the—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
I know one way you can do it.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
No -- you can't do that.
I don't know.
Apartment 306.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Could I please have a little water?
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
How can I help you with the particles?
Hold on a second here.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Hi, Roper.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Satisfied?
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You have to. It's a tradition.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
You know the ten commandments?
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
You know why I like the track?
I'm just practicing my lying.
To run last?
They need to run first and second?
There's your answer. He's smart.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
How many have you lost?
Is the hostage injured?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
I worship you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Please. I'm begging you.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
That a new picture?
You think I didn't need you?
It's already started.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
How's Paco doing?
...the hell are you talking about?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Tell him to give me a raise.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
And a car.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What do we got?
Are these yours?
What do you want?
What do you need?
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Why?
She said I have a son...
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You were right.
What's happening?
You are not a God.
The new world.
You were the one who was dying.
How long 'till we can eject?
The maze has been changed --
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Won't be time if he gets access --
An interface attendant.
Then how do you know about --
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
You said we were on the same programming team.
Voice activate.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Release the power WITH the power.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
I see... a fox
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
All systems go!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
I'm in!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Hey, boss!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What is THAT!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Anybody see them?
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
We're asking you to go to prison.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
I had everything. Once.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Inside, they were talking of you.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Charlie!
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
We'll figure out something.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
What the fuck does that mean?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
What are ya thinkin'?
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
You get fifteen percent.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
You're fuckin' crazy.
Who did this?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Monkeybone?
Olive or eyeball?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Uh huh. And?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
Dating anyone?
You know ...  ... whoops!
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
He's an organic farmer.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Tell me why!
Huh?
What! Who?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
What dame?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Yeah.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Where?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Taylor, my dear.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Oh--oh.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Will the Senator yield?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, I was--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
It does!
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
What?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Letitia.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Where do we go from here?
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Sure.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You want to see me, Senator?
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Why don't you do it yourself?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
You won't stand for it?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
How nice.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Yes.
Most every day.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are they true!
And you saw them happen?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
There's Times Square.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's the matter, hon?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Good night.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Did it?
How'd you get the picture?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Come on, come on!
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Yes, but you said—
Who? Miss Dawson?
How is this, sir?
Thank heaven.
He's what?
Your Honor, I object.
Newspaperman?
Hang up.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Where?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
No?
Yes. That is to say—
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
We provide opera.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
Let him alone.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
A what?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
South Dakota - north?
Tails tonight, sir?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
But you do therapy?
What an asshole!
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
What are you doing for lunch?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I was... never satisfied.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
What do you want to know?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
What it might take is... doing time.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Ph.D., psychologist.
When did you start to feel this way?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
What would you do?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Who else knows?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
But look at me now...
And the drugs?
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I never killed a priest before.
And what ritual would that be?
And how does one do that?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Immune from what?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
And what did he say?
No women allowed.
No?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
Is he supposed to look like that?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
You...! YOU...!
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
You did not!?... We're not!?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
We gotta get her back.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Atta, girl!
Who are you?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Hi.
Yeah.
I admire you.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
At the Frankenstein Center.
I'm going inside.
You're the Sphinx.
What are you talking about?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's just not enough of us.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Let's go.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Maybe she's right.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
The Obliterators!
Wow.
Really?
So what can I get you?
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
You did?
Hi.
Be a Mohican.
And there's the Sphinx.
To us!
Where am I going?
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Please...
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
There are none here.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
And where is the army?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Read it back.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
I haven't been there for three years.
Ah-hh, no.
My God...!  What time is it?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Promise.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Yes!!
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Why did you give it to him?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You could hear them?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Do you like music?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Why?
You know what this is?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
What we gonna do?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait.
Karla.
Huh?
You did all this for me?
Delivery!
Can I help you?
Here I come!
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
You too.
What kind of activity?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
I do.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Debo!  Debo!
'Take your car?'
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
What about that ugly dog?
Don't remind me.
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I need your help.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Who did?
This? I've never even fired one.
For what?
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
What...?
How should I...?
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Lynn!
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Please...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Thanks for the shine.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
Hey!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That's pretty good.
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
That's enough.
What do you figure he done with it?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Here they come.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What can we do, Mother?
He lied!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Hing, hang, hung.
John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Tell me what, boy?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
All right...  Come along.
I'll tell you a secret.
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
About our secrets.
Why, pray tell?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Get up, Willa.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
I been bad!
Miz Cooper!
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
How can you tell?
Worked like a charm.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Much better.
The killer.
How you plan to do that?
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Dad -- what you doing here?
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Who? Who did that?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Someone else was there.
And then what happened?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Do you think I did it?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
No more fights?
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
You want this?
That's her.
He's cutting our throat...
We had to take it on account of the safe.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
The former Duchess!
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
What time have you, Gaston?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can call our ambassador.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
We may have a chance.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Give me another double brandy.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
At what intervals does he whistle?
In other words you don't know.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Why do you need my finger?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
As a representative of Moscow...
Must one always be after something?
Will you smile?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Because we are an odd couple.
On which boat?
Did you make any change in this room?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
No speech.
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Would that make you any happier?
It's dead.
No music.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
You leave me no choice.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Unfortunately.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Good morning, Comrade.
Cigarette?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
We can't touch Hoover --
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
The army?
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Their fourth!
But what are we paying him for?
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Because they're not Americans.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Castro.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
... little Bobby.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
We took his system out.
Who do you think is behind it?
Why, you got a customer?
Where'd you find him?
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
How about Kissinger along with him?
It was illegal, what he did.
The lie?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
How many?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
Proud?
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
Yeah ... I'm out.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Buddy? ...
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
How'd you know I was here.
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
How come're you doin that?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
You're discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am?
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
That's the boy.
But you don't believe it.
What about yours?
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Don't get hurt.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Goin' where?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
What's that.
How'd you find it?
What airport would you use.
...You need to talk to me.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
This. And the gas.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Well... I need to close now --
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
How's that?
Good. I need everything else.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yessir.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
So was I.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Could I have that in American?
...I meant your food.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It wasn't a woman.
Did you send anyone out there?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Any idea where it is?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Need something else?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
You must be joking.
Who are these idiots?
Do you know why I'm here?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Did you watch it yet?
What?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Thanks...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
What's the matter here?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
No. Loma Vista.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
Were you with him this whole time?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa, so you've met David?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
What do you mean?
Like what?
Relax, we brought the cash.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
It's not here. Let's go.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
We can live with that.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
I'm not telling.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
I see.  May I?
Can I have an evil twin?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Yeah? The sport utility?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
It ain't the law!
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
That's right!
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Latch right on to that tit.
Helluva idea.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Okay, okay. You win.
Hi, Byron.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You... in the Navy?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
When did this happen?
Mayo, are those your friends?
You're good.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
What did you call me, Mayo?
Louder!
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Sid, there's no baby.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
That was you guys, huh?
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You serious about having him over?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
What did you tell him about the baby?
And you turned him down??
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
You got a girl?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
Jets.
Thanks for covering for me.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
No problem.
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Fuck.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Open it.
Be quiet.
Somebody called you?
What do you want?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Oh, I've seen these...
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
That's highly inappropriate.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
We're leaving.
Makes me nervous.
478...
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
Nope.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Fuck.
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
What, what, what is it?!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Call Dad!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Why?
What if I spazz out?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
What are you doing with the gun?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
So... we understand each other Judge?
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Now hold on Rodgers...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
We'll all get out of here together.
My Mom's at that.
This cool the heat off you any?
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Rose?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Congratulations.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know that.
What unit?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
What news?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
And your principles?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Where is he now?
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
It is ended.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Seventeen.
Father... I killed those men...
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Because you promised.
Ellie? What's wrong?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Then why do I have to go to bed?
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Was it Pascow?
Hey--they actually found the place!
You folks ready to go on?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
But--
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
But--
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
She's finally asleep.
Well, honey...you know that...
Getting there.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
You stole my boat.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
The situation has changed.
There's ... another exit?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Do you not know what this is, then?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
You?!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Say again?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Raise the sails.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
We had time to get to know each other.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
I can get you out of here.
It's still against the law.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Tortuga?
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
No.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
What happened here?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
What did you use?
... plastic.
I know what you're doing.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Like rotting meat.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Do you think she loves him?
Consideration?
Yeah?  So what?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I don't believe this is happening...
You're afraid of him.
Daniel...
When did you...?
Somebody has to.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Nothing really worthwhile.
... just like the mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Why do we need it?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
Susie... I...
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Icky!
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
You have the cutest nose I've—
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yeah!
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I bring a message from Garcia.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah.
Right - for the first time this year.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
You're my what?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
That's a canary, sir.
Yes.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
There you are—!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
To Old Madrid.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
What other girl—?
A statement? Good.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Hello, Smith.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
What is it, Smythe?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes sir.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Mary Sue?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Oh, hi ...
No she's not.
You can't go out there.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Sure is pretty.
Want some bridge mix?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Dan! Arrest them!
What's outside of Pleasantville?
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
God, David. Just give it to me!
Oh my God.
You know him?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Play along?
Who's that?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Jen, listen ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Sure.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Hi.
How?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Where are they?
I like calling you David.
... Like Prince Charming.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
How much does it cost?
Why would I do that?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What?
I want a word with you ...
OW!
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
How long do you think you've been here?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Oh, hi.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
Dream come true, hunh?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Well, I can't talk though --
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
Please don't.
You just said very food.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Yeah I can't.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Hello, this is Back.
Where are you?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Hi.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Alright?
Who is it?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
You like her?
....No....
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
This is Barry.
That was good.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
For work.....
Yes I'm sorry.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I cut myself.
On my knife.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
No one will know your name.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
What is this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Where you been?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
So they'll go.
What did you say?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
Are you ready?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I must grant him his last rites.
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
I have a proposition.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
-- water! --
Who's to say I did not?
NEVER!
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
And he's never once attempted escape?
And --?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll pass the word on, then.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Did I frighten you?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
-- words alone are insufficient.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Uh-huh
The actor
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
How bad is it?
It's not really--
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
I just want to understand--
Thank you for your time
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Hearst?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
What are movies about, Orson?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
The great Spanish bullfighter
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Sorry to disappoint.
How?
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
I'm sorry.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You gonna watch?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
It came.
You're going to destroy it
Pardon?
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
They wanna talk to you.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
What's up, Colonel?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
What's wrong?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Who's that?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Do you see her yet?
Stick out your hands, Jake.
Except fall down like a normal person.
How's that?
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Yeah. At night.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I can't find my ball.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
But, Jake, I was just...
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Where you been all day?
I called. You weren't there.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Jake, no --
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Who said they left then?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Wrong day?
Where?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Read some good books.
I'll send you some comic books.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's abnormal.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
We've progressed emotionally in --
People have different emotional levels that --
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
He and his wife splitting up?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
What do you need money for?
And your stomach?
And you love life?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
What a day I've had!
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Yeah.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
What doesn't?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Huh?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Machismo?
What you say your name was?
Buzz Gundersen.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
What's he going to pull--
No.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Mother--
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Will you let him tell it!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Is he there?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
What's your name!
I'm here.
What?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
That's swell.  How are you?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Who's that?
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Do I have to spell it out?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
He called me chicken.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
See?
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Goodbye!  See you!
No--I was just--maybe--
Why did you do that?
Where you going?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
After he tried to shoot you?
What's he like?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I was talking to Dad.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Negative five?
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Well, I don't know about that --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
...maybe I die for Nick...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He working for them on this one?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
That guy knows you?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
I saved your life.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
No, you can't --
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Hell. Ten?
What?
No.
No way.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Ash?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
You want that for here or to go?
What the hell was that about --
What about the money?
Monsters in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That's what it looks like!
Alone at last.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
You fuckin' wish.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I'll call somebody.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Me and Mr. White?
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
What's that?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Aren't you?
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Follow you where?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
You really think we were set up?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
No real people?
No shit?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Why!
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
It doesn't matter who they are.
What's the matter with her?
What's the matter with her?
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
They're stragglin'.
Are we leaving?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Thanks for taking over.
Where you going?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
That's right.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
I've got eleven horses.
Can I have my gun back?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
What's the matter -- restless?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
You're not giving up?
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Clay Phillips.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Would you like to learn them?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Well, Steve?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I won't let you do it.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Hello Brenda.
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
I meant you're into ghosts.
Where the hell are we?
Hey, look out, a bee!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Are you okay?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Noooo!!!
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I'm sorry.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
My God! Is she dead?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
What are you working on?
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Father, are you okay?
Yes.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Yo son, check this out.
This part removes the sense of humor.
"Ray!"
What a bitch!
Bring her home... I guess.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Because it's the rules!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Are you Chip Sutphin?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Hi, Hank.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Objection! Argumentative!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
What did you just say?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
And who may I ask is Carl?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What is it, Betty?
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Let's get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
About forty-five dollars.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Redi's all right.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What did she want?
What did she want to know?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
 What have you done about Irving August?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
Do you think he knows about this?
No!
Please, Jacqueline.
You'll be all right?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
And the other was Judd?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Yes. When I tell you.
What?
Dr. Judd?
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm afraid not.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
But she was here?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh, uh-huh.
Nine years?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I don't know.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
So what about kids?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
My therapist said that --
Of course not.
Are you in the middle of something?
Yes.
You just ask them questions?
To you?
How did you know?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
So you do fantasize?
Have you fantasized about me?
That's correct.
Her name was Elizabeth.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
And you feel the same way with John?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But that was part of it?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Graham...
John?
Yes. I just got busy.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
What do you mean?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
What visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Do you want to leave therapy?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
What?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
And what?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
So what's my share of the dress?
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
How do we start?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Your first sexual experience.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Were you disappointed?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I would.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
John?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
John Millaney.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Hung up.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
No.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
Hi.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Kiss, kiss?
Where is he now? Do you know?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
What happened?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
He didn't make it.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
You got it!
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
When do I get to see Brad?
SIN-I-FUL
How did you come by this scenario?
Why Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Could you tell us a little about it?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
Poor Brad.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
I want to see Brad.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
BRAD!
Our field.
She walks in beauty...
How's the trip?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You got it.
You okay, Miles?
They're from both of us.
Is it chicken?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Hi.
Are you a writer too?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
How old's she going to be?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
That's what you do with every one.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
It does. Feels right.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
We're on.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Later.
Right now.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Nice shot.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
We're on.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
She tell you she was married?
Me?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
What are you drinking?
Nice. Very nice.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Well...
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Okay. See you around.
Maya.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Oh, Maya. No.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
That's great.
Should we get dessert?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Houdini's sick.
No.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
The same windows.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
You do?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Pharmacy crowded?
How can you say that?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Chicken Teriyaki.
We won't be able to get out of there.
They're distracting us?
They're broadcasting...
Don't touch him.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
I can't even imagine.
It's the strangest thing Father.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
I don't think so.
Is he okay?
Is that him?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
You must have known that before you came.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You own this land.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Because they don't like what I want.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
This a friend of yours?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
What's stopping you?
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
You've got a legitimate job.
What brings you into my saloon?
What is it you want from me?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
You work here?
Nifty.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Is this a fair mix?
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Why isn't she with you?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Why not?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Is she here?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
You have to see her.
Not like this --
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Good-night, Daddy.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Do I know you?
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Simone.
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
The only real truth is in the work.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Are you calling me?
Why did you leave me?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Yes.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
--What?
Don't cry.
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I wish I were somewhere else.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
They?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Fuck you.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Suzie???
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Carl, what are you doing?
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
How... was she "called?"
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
It's time to make amends.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Ow!
Yes!
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
What about Jeremiah?
You're... limping.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like your guitar break.
Where's Mac?
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Sorry.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant, where'd you go?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
That wasn't a good night, no.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
Who's the lucky fella?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
What are you doing?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why're you driving so fast?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
So tell me about yourself.
Well?...
Guess what?
Can I ask you something?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Jesus!!!
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Kate...
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
No what?
Order up!
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Hit the brakes!
We still on schedule?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Bandit?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Never mind. It's nothing.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
I'm all ears.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Breaker. Breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Shut up, Fred.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Five thou.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
He's giving them up?
How bad?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Two of 'em?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Really?
Man, that's great.
What happened?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
That's probably him now...
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Does he know?
I wouldn't go that far.
So how we lookin'?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Listen --
You murdered her!
She'll come back.
You fucking bastard...
Is there anybody else here?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
What will you say?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
What plan?
We're taking a flight?
Not a very happy poem.
What do you remember?
What happened?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
But we fought.
You don't want me.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You want it coming back with us?
Straight ahead.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Put it on my account, please.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
You were reading my Renoir.
No dog.
What's to like?
You asked.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Claire?
What do you want to do?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
They guys treatin' you all right?
How long you going away for?
... Mike.
So.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
So how'd it go?
For how long?
Hey.  The neighbors.
She's got to identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I'd identify him.
She took you shopping for a tie?
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Ellie...
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
... Hard?
Are you in charge here?
No, I will not step outside.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Let my kid go.
Under the table.
Watch your step!
How are things going, pal?
How about dinner tonight?
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Flash, drop it--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Flash, get lost.
How are you doing, kid?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Would you cool it already?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
You should write that one down.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Waldos.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Peter, you're bleeding.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Creation? Or its opposite?
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Mr. Parker.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
There's only one pair left.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Private property, bub.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Have a cigar.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Then we're all in on it?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
What is this? This is water?
Shut up, Animal!
You can say that again!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
No, Animal.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
What do those broads say?
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
May I have this dance, Miss?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Anybody call?
Says me.
You could use a new one yourself.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
It's working.
Where is he now?
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
That's where he's going.
Population?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I get it. I get it.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, are you all right?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Do you remember him?
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Soran?
Can I?
Well, may we have a look around?
We don't have a tractor beam.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Antonia?
Close to retirement?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
But I do have a theory...
Keep her together until I get back.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Is there a problem?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Doctor Soran?
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
The royal...studs?
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
How many more?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Why would you do this...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Count on our help, sir.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What must I do?
What you ask is difficult.
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Sir, may I --
You amaze me, Commander.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
They even killed the galley chief.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
So are we, it looks like.
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's a long story.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They're still running with shields down.
Well?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Genesis, what's that?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Is the word given?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
They knew just where to hit us.
Not enough against their shields.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Spock!
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
On screen...
That was close --
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Sir, you did it.
Admiral on the bridge --
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
I would accept that as an axiom.
Humans make illogical decisions...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Now wait just a damn minute.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
It doesn't look all that different.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
I do not know your name.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
... Who are you?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
So. There we are.
... Gone?!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Warp two... three...
I have no control, sir!
Systems report.  Communications?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Bearing!
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Full power, sir.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Deceive us?
There are days.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
Will it?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
She's stabilizing.
Hello, Data...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
How many?
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
You're not finished here?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
I don't believe it happened that way.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Implants bothering you?
Full impulse.
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
I don't think they believe us.
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Captain...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Do you know what this is, Data?
Isn't it better like this...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Ready to make a little history?
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
What do you want?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
What makes you say that?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
Return to our own time?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What are they doing?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Figures.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
They'll respect him now...
My God, what happened here?
He's a DOCTOR!
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
She's here - somewhere.
They're preparing to fire.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
An INCIDENT?
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Thank you, Captain.
Your friends are late...
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Aye, sir.
Sorry -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
I always wanted to try that.
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
Never been this close.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I SHOULD have been -
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
How did you - ?
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
A lie?
If you are logical.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Trouble?
NO WAY!
And if they're still in place?
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Brother. I cannot move.
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No. I must deactivate you.
Indefinitely.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
And this makes you "sad"?
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
May I have this dance?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Sir, we're being hailed.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
We're being hailed.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Sir --
Why don't they answer our hails?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Anything.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
After you, Praetor.
What are you doing?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Not so long.
That's your life... not mine.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
What do you do?
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
Recognize this?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
That's the chance we have to take.
I just retired.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mrs. Haydn...
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?!
Are you from up there? Space?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
No... The closest...
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
The captain...
Yes.
Nobody knows.
Do you have music up there?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I love you.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
You sure this is your car?
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
You get that, Lyman?
You have no conception of this, do you?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
You married, Major?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Jesus.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Cut it out, Tran.
That's a good one, coming from you.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
What kind of things exactly?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
You were lucky, Max.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
So've I.  Too much.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
You just did.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
I thought we were friends.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I guess.
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Testa?
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Anybody talk to the press?
You run the plates?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Who knows.
What does the Manager say?
Dylan here.
Hi there.
You have the body?
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
I have 6 tons.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Look...
You're a... you're sick.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Why did you go to Chicago?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
None taken.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
He thinks he looks young.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
He's called a couple times.
And nobody else can do that?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Unlock these cuffs.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Agent Mackelway?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I don't carry it with me.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Was it Zero?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Thomas Mackelway.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
"MyDick?"
I don't...
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
You have to put things in perspective.
Ever since I've known you.
Thanks.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
How?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Oh my God.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Well... This is it.
I'll be around.
Well, I should be getting...
...Which one...?
Hello?
Lorraine?
Hi. Sorry about that.
How are you doing?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So what's the difference?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
I didn't mention her once today.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
You want to hit the town tonight?
How many strokes?
I'll give you an eight. 
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Sounds more like Aids...
Darwinism at its best.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
What's he do?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Are you ready to order?
Hello?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
It doesn't matter...
You're gonna screw up our plan.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
You gotta do it.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
I don't think so.
You think so?
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, you did fine.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Whatever.
I gotta use the phone.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
He drives a carriage.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
That was pretty cold, dude.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
Sorry man.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
And you?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
But your daughter is still alive.
What do you wish me to do?
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
You heard about your father?
Good for ten men...
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
I know.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Give them some money and send them home.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Will you give this to him.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Mike, why am I out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Buy me out?...
You think I scam?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
He's drowning me!
Who's this?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I'm intruding.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I'm never going back!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
And Rome.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Tom.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I never said that!
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Very.
You've got Dickie's rings.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I told you. He gave them to me.
It's all true.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Is this you?
This is spectacular.
What's funny?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Let's go.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
So -- are you travelling under R?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That's good, isn't it?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Not guilty.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Why lie?
Dickie Greenleaf?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
You got a .44 Magnum?
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Why?
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Damn.
Well... mostly...
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Try holding the match like this.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Stick up?
That ain't much of a name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Why should it be grounded?
Got your license?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
Who?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Travis.
What's the action around?
Real down.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Maybe.  Not really.
Spit it out.
He's got a gun, sir.
Well yes I suppose ...
Motor oil?
Limp dick?
What, vou?
Wait.
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
God's speed.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Dad?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Do you... remember me?
What.
I do?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
We were in love... weren't we?
Were we going to get married?
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
When did you start smoking?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Sir, that is true.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Why?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
You bet.
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
That's where you live.
What's wrong?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Is there a young Tim?
Found me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
That you got let go.
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
You hungry, son?
Miss Hayworth?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
How do you like our little hamlet?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then why did she object to you?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I see.
I did.
And the second?
Yes.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Is smoking fun?
Are you coming to my party?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
It's a surprise, you see.
Where would I get a boat?
Of course.
Yes.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Young woman cut herself.
Gulls!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Whose side are you on?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Tell him about the party.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
When do you think they'll come?
Maybe we ought to leave.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Then he saw.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
He was killed last night. By birds.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
I understand completely, sir.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
But how... how do you know my name?
How?
I didn't break that window!
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What's that?
What kind of law?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
Right next to the one you already had.
I'm sure.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
But you tore it up.
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I have several jobs.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Melanie, Melanie...
No, no...
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
When will they stop?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Birds?
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I'm cold as ice.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
I thought this was a school day.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
It might be an interesting case.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You've been with Gray again.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
Fuck! What do you want?
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
I heard you were looking for this.
Yeah, no kidding.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
Erin. It's not your fault.
No. You don't.
It's ok, it's ok...
Erin. Who?
Fucking crow.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
What's with your friend there?
But you, you've had them.
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
What? What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
You wrote this?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
He gave these to you?
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
What does that mean?
Go to the movies.
I don't believe it.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
No -- no, thanks.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
Why not?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Shut up!
Two down and two to go.
That's right.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where is she?!
What is this, David?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
What's that smell!?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Ouch, my hair...
It was a dream, Star.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
We're getting close...
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
Where's Michael?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Oh, no.  Now what?
Not impressed, are you?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Hi...
I'm Michael.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Where are we going?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Mom's home?...
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Too damn dangerous.
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Let's open it.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
MacReady!
MacReady!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
We should have jumped his ass.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
I guess you're okay.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Looks good.
Four!
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
What if it doesn't come?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Get back!!
Maybe it ain't coming.
You jerking off or just pissed?
You hear that?
Now how did you get hurt?
What do you do on the towers?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Do you know where they live?
When was his mother taken?
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Machines?
Vox?
Vox --
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
What?
It's spectacular...
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
Admiration?  My my.
I know it's not a diamond but --
You're late.
Darling.
Alex...?!
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
I know that --
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
You wouldn't believe me.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Is there a lot of illness?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Good night, then.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
All of you?
And this is your "work"?
I don't understand.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Yes, sir, he --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
How did you get hurt?
No, you're safe --
But... what about Starks?
Should we be...
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Did you know my father?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
We're late.
I need to get this letter to someone.
What're those?
I think I can remember what's on them.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I looked it up.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I have no idea.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
Where are we going?
What?
I think so.
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Can you drive?
I'm not sure.
What's this?
This is pretty good. Considering...
You like it?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Hey.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Armed robber.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
You're a bank robber?
What?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Where'd y'all go?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
What do you mean?
Call him?
That's puttin' it mildly.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
What happened to your hair?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
You think you've found your calling?
I want you to call Darryl.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Louise?  Where are we?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Sorry!
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
You do?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Thelma, that is not an option.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Shit!
You're a good friend.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is that up there?
You're a good friend.
We're fine!  How are you?
Oh, Jesus!
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
No harm, no foul?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Gay? He said you were gay?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
It must be great with a wife like that.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Never met him.
No You mean...?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Got cash.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom? What are you?
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Here's the info you asked for.
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Here, just have one of these then.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Don't you want to know my name?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
Fuck!!
All set.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Nope. Never been.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
What are you doing?
Miami?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Oh. Well I am.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Pat's an architect, too.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
What's up?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Now by killer, you mean...?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Please leave.
Go!
Ted...?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Is it the frank or the beans?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
And?
Slow down. Smell that?
What's it about?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
The sun came up today.
John. How much time?
How long until the army is ready?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
What's happened?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
How's my favorite President?
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
So what've we got today?
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
I don't want to listen to this again.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Mr. Clear Moon.
What are you doing?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'll sleep around a little.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
What are you --
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Still after Jimmy?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Jesus. Oil?
This Clear Moon's house?
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
I thought he'd never leave.
It would have been really embarrassing!
I beg your pardon.
Where did you see that?
Yes, ma'am.
It never came up.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
What if he's not?
What about the plane?
It dies. We live.
You're horrible
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
And now I want you.
I want it understood.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
I want it back.
You don't believe that.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Want to play the game?
What does it mean?
One more.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
MAVERICK.
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
This is crazy!
I'm pulling up.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
What are you doing?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I know!
I've got it -- hold on!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Is there something I should know?
You're not supposed to...
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
What do you want?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
You ever done this before?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Hear about Ice?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
I've seen this before.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
I can take care of myself.
For the same reason you are.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You think I shouldn't fly.
So, where to?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Do you expect me to believe you?
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Pull them out.
What, aliens?
You're Kuato, right?
Shit!
Why not?
Hey, Quaid!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Is that better?
...You mean it?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
No options.
I'm not interested in that.
This is too weird.
Forget I said wife.
Why would I lie to you?
So you dropped by to apologize?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
Where are you going?!
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
You sure about this?
...Who are you?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
She's got my vote.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
So long, cactus!
Jeez, look at that guy.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh, Jesus!!
Fuck you!
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Prairie dog burrow...
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
You go north, I'll go south.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Road's in!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
How's she doing?
Down, honey, down.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
And I appreciate it.
Ready?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Where?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
Do you have to do that?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
-- Find him?
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Figures.
-- About what?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
-- How could I help you?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Edward T. Dowd.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You getting this?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Five years.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
The phone company was broken up.
What color hair will she have?
I'm nearly out.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Don't get funny with me again.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
OK, Gordon.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Phillip?
And no one found the ring?
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Accidental?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Do you want to talk?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
What are you doing?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
James...
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
You want to see...
No.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Who was that?
No.
Dad?
Did you come home during the day last week?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Bobby didn't give you this?
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Four cases in three years...
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What are you doing here?
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
This is going to drive the ante up.
You would not...?
Just now...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
They lied.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Ed Concannon.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
The most respected...
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I object, your Honor...
Why?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Continental Casualty...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Another, Frank...?
Uh...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
That's right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What are you doing in New York...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Did it do you any good?
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They've all stopped at the same time.
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Where are we?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Must be somebody in there.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
What?
Time for sleep.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
What...happened?
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That was Nancy, not me!
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Uh...sure...when?
Can I get you something to drink?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
What are they doing?
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Albatross?
She isn't that old.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
He does.
Why'd you do it?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
I feel like I got you into this.
No way!
What are they doing?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
But you invited is aboard.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
What's that?
Me, too.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
Well, that was neighborly.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
What are we supposed to talk about?
Suicidal...
What are you blubbering about?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Yes, that's true.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What is it?
No shit?!?! You know him?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
So, it's back to the islands.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
You okay, honey?
Actin' funny how?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sailor!
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
What's that, peanut?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
How much we got left, honey?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
You're scarin' me, baby.
Oh God, Sailor.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Now what?
Sailor?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
So where'd you say you was?
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Just tell me what you want.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Mm.
He said something about being between things.
Is that just beer?
He is. Take my word for it.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
That was good.
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Crabtree.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Me? What can I do?
Is that in my chart?
Better luck next time.
Who's got a gun?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
You cold, James?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Thank you.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Yes.
Afraid so.
Washed up?
How did I get here last night?
How's that?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Maybe she didn't come here.
So, why did you take me up there?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
I'm sorry.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
So what are you going to do?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
He cribbed that from Borges.
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
You go first.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
And? Are you going to tell him?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Well...
Who's gun is that?
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
You heard? How?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Someone stole my car.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
He told you.
I'm through improvising.
I know.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Excuse me?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Who's that guy?
Maybe I should read it.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Five years.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
What are you doing?
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Ah, come on.
Nothing.
They're starlings.
It's not for sale.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Yeah, like the bird.
Walter.
No.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
That's right.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Try it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
I don't know.
Please don't do it again.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Sorry.  Where is she?
And what are you doing?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
What else?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Very weird.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Something happened to you.
So... what's your dark secret?
Did I say something wrong?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
I'm sorry, Walter.
They seduce you?
You really believe that?
All three -- in chronological order.
Are you serious?
What's this?
I don't need a plant.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
How you guys doing?
What's goin' on, Boss?
Where are we?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I haven't worn mine in months.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
What about O-2?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
He's got the shakes?
Well, that's that.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I don't know how!
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Virgil?
Do we just leave him there?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
You better not say you missed that.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
4800 feet.  It's official.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Don't be so humble.
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Are you feeling better?
Yes, you should go.
Oh, Sandro...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
What is it, Claudia?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
That's why I asked you...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
It's divine!
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Don't you ever paint men?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Thank you.
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
I would like to ask you something.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
I don't know.
Why?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
No I'm not.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Who?
Often?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
Don't you know?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
What do you mean?
Anything?
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
Why should I?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
You have trouble sleeping?
Who?
Did your mother see angels often?
Why not?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
What the child?
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
She's dead isn't she?
Yes?
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
And why am I here?
I'm frightened.
Of telling you.
Why were you afraid?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
What is it?
No.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Him.
It was dead.
You saw it all didn't you?
H... how?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Larry...
???
All I want is one more week.
I'll have it.
No, no, no...
No!
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Yes.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
I am...
What?
How?
Visitors to the convent.
There's nothing here.
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
Listening to angels?
She molested her!
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Fine thanks...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Mary Magdelen?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
For Agnes.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Don't be ridiculous.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But how did it happen?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Somebody told her.
The baby?
That's enough.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Eight and two thirds.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
You don't think...
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ever seen one of these before?
We're nearly there, sir.
Are you going in?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Get him out of here!!
Gerron.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Sure. .
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
I don't think that bit's right.
I see.  Do you like the play?
But that's not like a real person at all.
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What are you doing?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Yeah ... so what?
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Anything to spare?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go and muck in.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
What's old got to do with it?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
And my nose...
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
He's betrayed the class.
Well!
Stop picking on him.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
How's that?
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Locked.
Are you in pain?
Just machinery.
What's up?
Are you okay in there?
I have recorded the transmission.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
How long to fix?
Well, get started.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened to the lights?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Where did it come from?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
What?  What was that?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
This looks ancient.
What'd he say?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
Oh God, oh God no.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
We do know that.
What the hell happened?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Martin?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I understand why you did that.
Would somebody fill me in?
Engaged.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Let's get back and call this in.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Picking up velocity.
De Vries?
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
What?  Where?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
And...?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
Okay, we're in business.
Six month stint on Datus.
Seltzer?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
I've found Ackland!
Do you believe him?
What?
That's the wrong way!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
You have to...
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than modest.
It needn't be.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Champion to champion.
What do you mean by that?
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Then say so.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Naturally enough, your understudy.
In time she'll be what you are.
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
Macbeth.
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
I told her. I sounded off.
Take care of yourself out there...
Bill...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Then you're crazy.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, darling...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She did...?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
It's a good thought.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Paranoiac!
It's not nonsense.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Why?
Just wondered what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Don't run away, Bill.
- and for you.
You think?
Lemme fix you a drink.
The same size?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
Late for what?
What are you doing here?
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
She's got to meet you-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
You won't forget it?
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
How far to the station?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Coming?
It's just possible she didn't...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
I'm glad Bill's back.
Well of all-
- well? What happened?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Yes, sir.
Hello..
Play it again.
"Liebestraum."
When's the audition?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Promise.
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
Carl?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
--what do you think?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
And?--And?--
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Goddamnit--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What's the matter?
--Jesus--
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
--what time is it?
Morning or night?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
What's a real denial?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Hey... very tense.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
FBI too?
Hey, easy...
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
So tell me about the Times article.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
But they both worked at the White House?
Same kind of crap--
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Go on.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
What?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
Where in government?
Are you sure?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
More denunciations?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Go on.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Good morning gentleman.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Not bad, Chris.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Um...Chris --
What's your middle name?
You don't like it?
I wasn't making fun of you.
So you're going to Michigan?
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
He likes it.
Do you?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
And you said...
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Like a bet?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Can I come in?
I know, Dad.
Dad!  I know!
Dad.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes.  Seriously.
...excuse me?!
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
I still think you're okay.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
Yes.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Shame on you!
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh, Kev.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Yeah.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Say that again, Kevin?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Okay, explain.
Bullshit.  From where?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
The key is don't look down.
Merde! I can't believe this!
God. How can you eat like that?
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Like an underground club?
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
They're coming!
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
We don't both have to die.
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Nothing's happening!
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Where is it! Please!
What do you mean, maniacs?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Shit. I feel sick.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Are you running away?
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
No! I look ridiculous!
Poor Meetoo!
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Nervous?
Anya, wait!
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
What?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
What was that?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
You're a princess...
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
See? The Princess is under there ...
The "Odessa Dunk"?
So where will you go?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
I had nothing to do with it!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Perhaps you could convince her?
Who's on television?
Singer!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
It's an important issue.
Lyndon Johnson?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, you're driving a-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Oh, right.
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Duane?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah?
Okay?
We can digest our-
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
And blind people, crippled...
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
That's the key question.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Yes, it is.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Uh-uh-why?
M'hm.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Yeah.
You followed me!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
What's- It's me, open up.
Oooh.
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Two?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Check it out.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Tsch, a few.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
I mean that as a compliment.
Oh.
Charlie Chaplin.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Sixteen years ago.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Forget it, Max.
Yeah, watch the road!
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Well, sit down.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You fired the cleaning woman?
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
M'mmm.
No, no, no, not at all.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
She's a constant surprise.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
She already has.
What what's about?
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Never.
So where is young Jonah?
Thanks for coming.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
I'm the hired help.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
It was fifteen seconds.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
Not millions.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Scout's honor.
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
What did you get me?
Kiss the back of my knees.
What?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Two minutes.
Okay, knock it off.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
About me!
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Yes.
Happy anniversary.
Panes!  How are you?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
No.
Yes I did.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Sally did all this herself?
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Scout's honor.
Are you okay?
I'm a little in the puke zone.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Yes.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Of course it's alright.
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
What?
I'm so sorry.
Is there space here?
I was impressed.
That was my clue.
Panes is here!
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
She's all over him, are you blind?
We're just feeling our way back.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Nevermind.
So where should I put it?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
Well good.  Thank God.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Worker!  Come back here now!
Out here I'm just what?
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Come on, Z.
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Barbatus!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Yes, what else?
...I should?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
This the place?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
What gave you that idea?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
And where are you now?
Your stomach?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
What for?
You sure you want to throw that card?
There's a call for you --
What are you doing with that?
Thank you.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Oh.
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Would you mind repeating the question?
You do?
Who?
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Hi, Baxter.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
How do you spell her last name?
Help yourself.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
What about him?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Not so rough, honey.
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Sleeping pills.
Dreyfuss.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
You fool -- you damn fool.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How long has it been -- a month?
That's enough, Fran.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Where does she live?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Where are you headed?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
What !
Winning the war by yourself.
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
I was an FO for the 25th.
How long were you up there ?
Why they call you that?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
How?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Can I go get those mangos now?
What'd he say?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
I never heard about that.
They nail him for it bad ?
What does that mean ?
Terminate ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
No, sir.
American weapons?
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
You smell that.  You smell that?
What do you mean?
What's the furthest you been in?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Fucking savages.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Do you?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
The other one --
What?
Captain Willard?
This boat's a mess.
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
That's 27, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
20   CONTINUED:  
23   CONTINUED:
30   CONTINUED:
117  CONTINUED:  
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
27   CONTINUED:
Had?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Have you talked to Eric?
Where'd you say Eric is?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Stay here.
That's not what I meant.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Where's Corbett?
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Leave it here.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Ben Corbett?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
Does he have people?
Stay put!
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
It was blown up with the plane.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I already have.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
What's wrong?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
It's Sam Wilder!
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
Spencer.
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
What about your mother?
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So you'll be at work?
So. Anything else?
Lovely.
I can't. I work.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
Stop asking everyone.
You wanna dance?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
No!!!
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
But what about...
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
What?
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Is he dead yet?
Oh, is he dead?
No, I didn't.
Please, just leave.
Not it at all, really.
I told you to go on in.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Did you like it that much?
But you know where you're lucky?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Is there a problem?
Why?  What happened?
What are you doing?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Michael?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
What?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
A player?
Bullshit.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
You want me to pump?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Someone hired both of you?
Forget it!
I don't need the money.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
How?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
He was... taken.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
That's where he'll be.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
What do you think he's doing?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
Yes.
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
They're worth less points.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
I went into their room this afternoon.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Why?  I don't know.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Was she the only one?
Uh-huh.
That doesn't sound normal.
Was nice.
I thought it was interesting --
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
For what?
Then, I'll sail alone.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Why didn't you fade?
Yeah.
This will take some time.
What are you having?
So how's your work?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Because it's in English?
But we are underground?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Squatted it.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Destroy the evidence huh.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Perfect!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
No, We aren't going to do it.
My God! What happened?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Damn!
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
God, I think I need a holiday.
I made a deal with Josh.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
It's that one isn't it.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
We should be done by the weekend.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
She's tired.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Will it help to get you out?
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, they are students.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
And take Jiri with you?
I thought I'd help out.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
We_re not all running away
What would you like, beer?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Better than you.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
You will wish you hadn't.
Enjoying our hospitality?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
And the students?
Would you like your things now?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Sure!
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
I don't want to go.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
You are quite sure it's secure?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
So go dance.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
It could help with a new car --
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I told him to leave me alone.
Deranged.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I know you don't want help.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Saturn. Beautiful.
Looking for intelligent life?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You have to believe to have faith.
All of it.
She great or what?
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
What do you actually know with religion?
How do you know this place?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Ergo?
From citizen high to citizen low.
One of your secrets.
Why didn't you tell me?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Will you do something for me?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Did you give him a gift?
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
So talk to us about something.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Landon. You go on home.
I thought she built it herself.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Morning Dick.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Huh?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You mean, you're gonna --
Your line, George!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
What?!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Marty, that would alter history.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
How did you know?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
That's just what I needed to hear.
There's no way of knowing.
Obviously!  
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
I'll catch up with you.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Does he bite?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Well, Kit...
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
Hi.
Okay.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
You still in school?
Doing what?
Quit my job.
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
My stomach's growling.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
I can look and see.
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Is he upset?
What'd you put him in there for?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Don't.
No.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
What?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Hi.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
This your place?
Yes.
Hi.
You tossed my hat out the window.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Planet 10?
Then what?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
What crate?
You okay?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Dead.  Damnit!
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
But John Whorfin said kill her.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I see.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
If you could, I'd –
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I write.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
...Huh? No, I'm –
I'm a writer. Ted O –
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I don't understand-
...Barton, is everything okay?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Howdy, neighbor.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
Yeah, but –
You're leaving?
Are you sure –
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Sure, Charlie.
It's more than I've got.
...Where did we put him?
Yes sir.
...Those your only bags?
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Big fuckin' deal.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Take care, you hear?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What is this interest you've got in her?
What are you doing here?
Did you leave the club with him?
Did you go home with him?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I didn't.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
Did you think it was so special?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
No.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
How'd you get in here?
No.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Thanks.
What you doin', son?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't know.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Where the hell you goin'?
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You look like dogshit.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Were you with him last night?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
She's a suspect.
Who are you?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
I'm a painter, too.
Naa..
Ouch..
What's with the wigs?
Who is it?
These are great.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Would you like to see the wine list?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
You got a date already?
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Check you later, man.
We got beat.
Drugs??!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I thought you hated this place?
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
That is amazing. What year is it?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
I'll take the whole tin.
I really... admire you.
See you later.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
It's cold.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Didn't I say that?
Pouring myself into my work.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
And the truth frightened her?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
What happened?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
... eight, seven...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Uncle Alfred?
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Alfred, are you...?
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
You're loosing your cool
Nice suit.  And today you are?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I was just hanging around.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
No sign of the snowman.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
No!?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You will rescue my wife
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
The dreams again, sir?
It'll never work.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
...A bat.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Rinka.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
What do you know about obsession?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Back off, man.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I'll show you it works.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Go ahead. You can say it.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
GET IN THE CAR!!
I'll have to ask you for that film.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
... How long have I been out?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
How'd you find this place?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
No.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
All street mimes should be executed.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
... Thank you.
And you want a --
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
There aren't hotels?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
No!
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Bye, Dad.
It is urgent, sir.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Me first.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
That's not that much.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Uh, you first.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Uh... bye-bye.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Does that say Xanax?
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Talk ta me, Bork.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Really? That's where we're from.
Who sent ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Oh no.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
What?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
I feel really stupid.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
What?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Help vouchers?
Aren't you dead?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
We're very unhappy.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Is there much more of this torture?
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... And please call me Robert.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Can you see well?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes, it is very good!
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Bravo!
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Certainly, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
What about money?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
... My suitcase.
... Evening, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
Well, ain't that the truth...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Sid, it's useless!
You heard?
Do you feel well enough for that?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
... How are the kids getting along?
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
... Well?
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Which one is Elijah again?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
We?
Don't forget me.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I need a shower.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I know.
I know. I'm sorry...
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Yex?
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Emily Dickinson.
Yes, well...
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
This is important!
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
What kind of circumstances?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Forget it.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Anybody else?
But of course.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Yeah, I saw them
Never heard of it.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Come on in.
You still there, sweets?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
You've got to be kidding.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
She gone like they say?
Well, good luck with the job.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Be here. In case.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
But mama..
No...no...no..
Can't locate him.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
What run him off? Tell me that!
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You remember your price, Stamp?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
No, You looking good.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What, baby?
What? What? You talking back to me?
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Excuse me?
Fuckin' A.
Who has your undies, Walter?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Are you gonna split hairs?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please!  Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No, they--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Huh?
Excuse me?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Yeah, but my-
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
So...that doctor.
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Theodore Herzel.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
...Huh?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Uh-huh.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
There weren't any shots.
It's a heart attack.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Ah fuck it.
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
You come all the way down here to roust--
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
You're hurt.
Blade.
Why do you hate us so much?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
And why is that?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Tell me something, Skid --
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Going on twenty years now.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Whistler!
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Who dies first?
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You shouldn't be here.
But he's a policeman --
What are you doing?!
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You're hurt --
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You don't look so good.
-- tearing me -- apart.
No --
How's it going, Kam?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
We keep in radio contact.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
What happened to the power?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Domini?
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Why are we here?
What's she look like?
Oak?
Yeah, so?
--<u>myth</u>--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Baby names?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
--like you hurt the baby--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
What movies?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
Cotter?
Boy Kurth.
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Nobody's going anywhere--
Cotter?
Okay, but--
Let's get inside.
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Why?
Oooh. Oooh.
Pointless.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Are you alright?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Heather.
Spare me.
I can't do it!
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...Ray?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Hello?
...Ray?
...You called me this morning.
...Who?
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
So how long have you know Meurice?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Well now you do.
You want me to kill 'em.
Well what?
Dead, huh?
...What did you do with the bodies?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Howdy stranger.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Hello, daddy.
Where are we going, Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Do you like my body?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I want you to hurt me.
I asked first.
Dorothy. no!
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
On a ride.
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah. but.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
What's with Mike?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Did you see her undressed?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. be careful.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Okay.
It's good to see you.
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Probably not. no. Why?
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
What are watchin' this junk for?
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Blanca, por favor.
This is it for me.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What did I tell you?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What's that?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
What do you got there, Diego?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
What type of planes do you have?
Diego?  It's George.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Touche.
I'm calling it three.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
In how long?  A week?
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I'm sorry, George.
I know.
What are you going to do?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
Figured it out.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
But this is...
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
What?
What do you want from me?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
For instance, something like this?
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Stoned?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Third group. What's your assignment?
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
No ...
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Yeah.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
No questions.
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
You've been following me?
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
What about Miss Lawson?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I suppose.
No.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
I'm the photographer.
You and me -- making love.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
Alone?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
What are they saying?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Really.
Can't it wait?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
What's wrong?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Lemon?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Is the dizziness gone?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Why, do you think?
I'm sorry. That was...
When?
Francesca?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But it's not the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Francesca?
Am I interrupting anything?
Okay. See you later.
Oh.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
What were you like when you were younger?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
You're somewhere else, where?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
What about your husband?
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
About an hour ago.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
It clearly states in the will --
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Where's the others?
Those 'fools' are my people.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aren't you going to join us?
And what's that?
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Are they on the radio?
What else does she say?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You gotta use your imagination.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Open the case!
The money!
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
We're family, Caesar.
Not bad.  What for?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
It couldn't have been.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Tell them!  Tell them!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What did she do to you?
We were in a car accident --
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Another time.
Where is it?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
See?  We're for real.
This is a beautiful place.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Who?
So this is temporary for you?
Are they really?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
Five years is a long time.
What are you afraid of?
What you heard wasn't sex.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Gino Marzzone.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
Any bodyguards?
I'm just asking, what if?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
okay, all right.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I know you will.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
-- he went inside! --
We don't know what we're into!
I'm going to Paris.
I think so.
Are you Treadstone?
I don't know.
So now you know.
I don't think so.
Who do you think sent me?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
We thought you were gone for good.
Was it the break-in?
I need a ride out of here.
Jesus...
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
What does that mean?
That's what I'm saying.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Where?
I trusted you.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
He run away often?
Wait a minute --
What?
What?
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
What if it doesn't come back?
...Be back.
You telephone, sir.
What have you got there?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Go away.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Gillian Layton?
Sam!
What's the matter?
You are late.
Triplets.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Enough though, eh?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
Tell me about Layton.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Out of kindness.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Take her off the list.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Yes we have, Jack!
You stupid bastard!
Where do I get it stamped?
Who are you? Let go!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Don't litter my cab!
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Where are you taking me?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
No, really.
Look at that - right on time.
They'll be there waiting.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
They're gone.
Don't you like parties?
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
Would you really, Sam?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
That's it.
I never signed the form.
What?
You want to take my console into your office?
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Sam!!! 
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Er, don't you want to search me?
But I could be anybody.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Are we?
What?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
The pace?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Is she dying?
You know each other a long time?
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
I guess I'll be going.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Okay, what happened?
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
You're not going to die.
Here, you try.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Do you have any music?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
You married?
Promise you won't go inside.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Three legs.
He one of them?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
You okay?
Whadda we bring?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Turn it off.
Mr. Oh.
They'll just keep calling.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Shit, shit, shit...
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Keep it to yourself.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Wait.
No.  No.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
What did they do with you?
London.
That's your full name?
He must have been great-looking, right?
I'd give anything if that were true.
I write for you sometimes.
Well, whatever you think.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
No.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Don't go.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
So who's the guy?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Jane?
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
How do I get out of here?
What?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Is everything all right?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
You don't have to finish tonight.
If we could just eat first.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
Hi.
So he was indicted?
I didn't think you'd make it.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
It's incredible who's here.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
At least kiss me when you do that.
What?
That's not it.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
Then give me a minute...
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
You're saying stay away from him.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
That doesn't look like very much clay.
A girl with a body like mine?
Alright we're clear.
Hi Walter.
Is it murdered man?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Here you go, enjoy.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Hi Walter...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you trying to be funny?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
What's the matter with you?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man look at that get up !
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
A show..how soon can we go?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Man has a complex.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
I'm hungry.
Hi, Buffy.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
What show is this?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
I am a God!  A God!
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Well, stay here tonight.
Where are you gonna go?
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
I'm going to the dance.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I'm going out the front.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Bugs.
Like what?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Beverly Center.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Time to do what?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Where's the other one?
Oh, him.
What?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Watchers?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I want to die.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
I never thought of that.
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You said "Crash".
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
The right nostril.  Good.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Death is like spring training?
I'll tuck you in.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I think you're real cute.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
She's dancing with me.
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Your place or mine?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
He's a good student.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm trying to thank you.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Nuke--  Good luck.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Take the first shot at me.
No.
Little high.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Stop -
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Back -
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
You've got to stop her.
Half of everything is mine.
Sam, we got a problem.
I'll be right back.
Okay, thank you for asking.
Any change?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Oh, fabulous.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Huh?
You can't make me stop caring...
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
How serious?
I bought him a watch too.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
The arrangement is over!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Get - Get up! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Just wait there for me!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Yeah, okay.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
This is not the way to treat people.
...worst possible time for me.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
No.
No, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
What expenses?
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Come on. I'm sorry.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Is that what you did?
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Hi, Jennifer.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
Thank you.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Great.
Yes!
I'm here.
Do you know that?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
I just talked to him.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Yes, don't worry.
Mm-hm.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Smarten up.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
And this is Stacy.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Don't know.
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Charlie M?
You're a little confused?
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
Again!
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hi.
Works for me.

Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Women, huh?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I better go report this in...
You're kidding.
We're waiting.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Pass!
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
How much?
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Nice breasts.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Was someone in an accident?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Will you two cut it out?
You gotta just look the other way.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Lose the hardware now.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Who smashed the phone?
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
"Theo?"
26th off Wilshire.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
It won't be him.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
Whose money is this?
You timed that beautifully.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
You were at the Emerald that night?
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
That's a reasonable possibility.
Know what else is in here?
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
What time frame have you got in mind?
Sure.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here.  Where are you?
It's in the process.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Yeah?
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
I can see the benefit in that.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Where do I turn?
Where's the backpack?
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Can I make a quick call?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
It takes all types.
He's what she should run a mile from.
You could always make it up to her.
He gave me a look.
Saw that one.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's still looking, Col.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Thank you.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Take your clothes.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
You American?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
You old-fashioned?
You want me to ask you in, right?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Piss off, Dave!
Would you like a drink?
He was different.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Why?
Will you meet me again?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Details, baby, details.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
She own you, Jimmy?
What you doing, Jimmy?
Why?
You promise?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You tried.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
More endearments.
Love me.
You do?
Yes. Now.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Jude?
Who's the old geezer?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why would you do that?
What the fuck is this?
Back in a minute, Jody
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
He's at home.
Hope not.
So it's on the street.
Eat something, would you?
I seen your fucking face.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
They won't let him die.
Why can't we?
C'mere.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having two pints in the Rock.
The best.
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
What?
See if she's all right.
What?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
And you know what?
Oh, you should see your face.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
What is it?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I said, tell me to go to the --
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Café.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No.
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Around one.
What's your first name today?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
But you're -- divorced?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Scobie?
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
You can't.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I'd love some, thanks.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert --
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
He was American?
About how wealthy would you say?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Did you?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
How's that?
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
What are you doing here?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Doing what?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
You mean you and me?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Do you know what's wrong with you?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
He knows everything.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Who is it from?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
is there anything you do?
You're grounded Friday night!
Ok.
You found her?
What happened?
Well?
No.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
_ Your father raped someone?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Oh nice save.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
This place is empty.
Why?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Are you coming to the party?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
What?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
What?
Hide your laptop here.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
At least somebody likes this shit.
help me get in the truck. 

Shit!
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Great. 
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Huh?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
What did I say?
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
All right, then how about this?
...doing?!
Go on.
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...-ed.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, no, no.
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.

 
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Shut up.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
I did not steal the truck.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
Come on, old...
Fuck! 
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
That's right.  Now,  move!

Come on, old Pete.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
What the fuck was that?!
Shut up!
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
...here!
Come on!

Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Robert Del Rio?
Listen, Arlo...

...deal with this asshole.
Ow!  
Arlo!  Arlo.
 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 
...-natic.
...to him. 
We!
Here...
...tunnel!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Oh.
What?


Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
We're worried...

But...
Vaughn.

 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
We've got it...

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...about--
You look fit...healthy...
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Do you know what'll...
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Of which we have more than enough.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.

It's clean.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Richard Long.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Iced coffee.
Doc...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Yeah?
I don't see my container.



No.



...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Yeah?
Oh, no?
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...somehow. 
Ah.
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Great.  All right...
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
Thanks. 
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...without caution...
Call an ambulance.
...-m-means, Mason.  
What?  Say again, Ma-...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...public drunkenness....
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...tunnel now!
Don't move!
  All right.
 
Get in 
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Negative.  Negative.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
They're calling it an accident.
Why is that funny?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Is she all right?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
She's just no good.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
In the garage.
Off the alley.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
Why?
I'm not.
The apple core?
Hello, Jake.
Thanks, Lou.
Looking for someone.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
What are you talking about?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Mr. Gittes.
Not that Mulwray?
That's not his apartment.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
How did it happen?
Another satisfied client?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Then it was over the water department.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
It was in Chinatown.
As little as possible.
...No. Why was it.
What's wrong?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
And I want to know where.
Do? To who?
Yes.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
Let me handle that.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Yeah, Sophie.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
When it comes.
Come again?
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Yeah?... I do?
No, really?
Of course not.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
They were partners.
Apple core?
So he says you sent them?
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
That's for sure.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
How's school?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
But...who...
I don't care. I'll wait.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Then where's the money?
Mr. Kane -
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Wasted?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
No, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
I'm sure that's it. 
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Oh!!
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Ow!
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Where's the soap?
Where's the towel?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Yes -
At night?
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
What's this?
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Who told you you could sit down here?
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
What's this?
Beats me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Dick.
So where is he?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I was here the whole time.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
It's not what you think.
No.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
You work in a market, all right.
You're such an asshole.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
This is the last time I come to this place.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
You only brought one ball?!
That's what I said.
What time do you have to stay till?
She called me.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
The Emperor.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
What's he looking for?
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
See? There you go again.
At least we're stuck here together.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
She meant nothing to you!
You were saying?
An embolism in a pool.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
May I be blunt with you?
Jesus!
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Then how come you got the fine?
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
What did she say?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Thirty-seven.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
It's not like I'm miles away.
Do you work tomorrow?
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Do I know you?
You know him?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
You used to go out with her?
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Oh... Can I help you?
Yeah, but...
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Why did you agree to come in then?
You're kidding.
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
I was kidding.
"Be there?"
And I actually date you?
How many girls have you slept with?
What the hell was that for?
Where?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
What do you mean?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
And that made you feel better?
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
What are you talking about?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
No way!
He really wants to play metal?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
I do about three-fifty, four.
To an Asian design major.
Really?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I beg your pardon!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
I will. Take it easy.
C-4?
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Go on, fetch.
She's losing it!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Four...five...
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
I can't believe you just said that.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
No luck?
Pull it apart!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Take the rope.
What about you?!
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Murdering, motherfucker...
Travers, you're not running things.
Yeah...
Then where the fuck is!
Got to be Comb Bluff.
I don't know about totally.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Where's the third one, Travers?
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Is it set?
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Help you.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Fine, sir, fine.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
It's alright, thank you.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
What job and how much?
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Fine, fine.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
No, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Just part of hospital routine.
Yes?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
It's no big deal.
Like what?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
You need a vacation.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Where are you, what floor?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Remember what you played?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
You guys been holding hands?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
...if they're wrong?!
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I brought you flowers.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
You're kidding me.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
He's not paying you one cent!
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
First time in New York?
You prefer nights?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
I think he's dead.
Good.  Help me out here.
Got it?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
You listening to me?
What are you doing?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Are you breathing?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Another collateral.
Collateral damage.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Max?  What are you doing?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Show up for what?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
In case he asks.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
And you believe me...?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Max?
The sound of love.
That's love.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
I don't see the connection.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Not for years.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Yes.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
That's it?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
What are you doing?
Has this happened to you before?
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
My father's house.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
I don't understand.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Then tell me what happened.
Love at first sight?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Without a song in my heart.
How did you know?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
What gave me away?
What?
We've lost contact.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
I disagree.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
What is it?  What's happened?
You mean --
Do you have a minute -- ?
You...
What...
Dr. Cullers?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Can't we get rid of them?
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear to the moon?
Pensacola.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
So who...?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
So.  What happens now?
You live here.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
What's that?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
You sonofabitch.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
I flinched.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
How do you mean?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
But --
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Buck is a deal.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
You got your mind right, Luke?
Here's the Patrol.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Well, whatta we got here?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Man Oh Man.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
But -- but --
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
I can't, Andy.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
We'll get the paramedics...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
What book?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
But it's a different m.o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Is that it?
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
It's a woman shot in a car?
Don't hang up!
Yes.
Open the door.  Please.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Who came in after you?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
What's wrong with him?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
We could use a little help.
So what have we got?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
What the hell you need her for?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
There, that's better.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
What do you think of this one?
Yeah, everything's under control.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Will you get time off to do that?
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
It had this red spot on its back.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Don't take it personally.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
I wish I could have seen that.
What else would you do?
Then it's over.
I do.
Well?
Tell me all.
Furnished?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love your apartment.
The store was busy.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Something like that.
What?
I sure know what that feels like.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
So, another one bites the dust.
Can I put these here for tonight?
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
No, you've done a perfect job.
You what?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Getting back.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
All tapped out.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
What are you doing?
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Who?
Oui.
No.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
But you were there?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And the other half?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Why not just steal another one?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I'm going to kill him myself!
I thought they came with batteries.
That moron.
You're sure?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Guns.   Can you get them?
I'm from Belgium.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
The map said to go left.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
This kind.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
-- I want to be Elvis.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
It's good.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
I can't even hear myself think.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
Why?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Where's your master?
Why do you want to teach me?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Tell me, who is your master?
You're already a thief.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Put them down.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You're not married, are you?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Where is he now?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Never!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No.
She needs direction... and training.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
I don't know...
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
What in the hell... do you call that?
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
They couldn't do anything for me.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
You look like a rock star without a job.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Top Dollar.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
How the hell did you do that?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I'm Kathryn.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
I have his journal.
Nothing.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
About what?
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay?
What?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Hi.
Why aren't you understanding?
German.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Are you shitting me?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Those are my letters!
See that wasn't so bad.
That was cool.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
What do I do then?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
It's like a secret society.
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
And then I can go home?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Want a blow job?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
My daughter, Rachel.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Is she with you?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
What do you mean?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Sorry.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Call me later.
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I'm at your service.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Morning!
Exactly the opposite.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Get off me!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Oh, hello.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What song, dear?
Mommy --
But where did you get it, Amy?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
I got lots of presents.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
Certain wishes do.
What do you want. Amy?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
These are all from me.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
Daddy?
Who are you?
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
But you must!
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Oh, how beautiful!
Merry Christmas.
It stands so still.
You mustn't be afraid.
A lady threw it to me.
It's a pretty ring.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
It got hit.
Mommy read it to ne.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hurry!
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Waiter! She needs more water.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
How have you been feeling?
Jennifer?
He's a very talented musician.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Or if there's a full moon.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
Why would they exaggerate?
What? Why the hell did he do that?
At least your PMS is over.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
How'd it go with the cop?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Hello?
Peter knows something.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Where'd you get the bike?
Script coverage?
No.
You wanna get some coffee?
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
What are they for?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Except Mark of course.
Hello?
How do you know?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Be careful!
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No, it was our first date.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
How the hell is that your business?
See he was cheating from the get go.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
His wife.
Police.  Nobody move.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Please, they'll kill me...
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
Which one?
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Someoneís after me.
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
What are you doing?
Why?
It's a trick.
How do you know I'm innocent?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Dave...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this?
Choices???
Oh... I'm fired?
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
You're kidding.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
At a press conference.
What do you mean you made it all up?
This is wrong, Alan!
`Dave'?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
This is from the people of Burundi...
They re not my attack dogs.
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
You're kidding.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
That was quite a thing you did today.
How were you gonna get home?
Are you hungry?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
What's wrong?
So this is it?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
His madness....could be from shock.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
What?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
It's because of me.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
How was dinner?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
So?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Well...
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Don't stop.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
You what?!  How did you do that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Pleased to meet you.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh-huh.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
Weird.
So what do you think of my father?
What is it then?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
How do we get out of here?
Who?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Now look what you did!
What are those things?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Like cattle...
What is it?
Looking good...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
Let's just keep going.
Shut up! You hear me!!
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
What did you do the my kids!!
It's okay...come on...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Man, don't go up there...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
She fucked you?
Fuel up. Need fuel.
I'll get the boots.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Yes, Albert?
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Ammo! Get the ammo!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Let's go!!!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
You are his friend.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Get anything?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Sal.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
But --
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?
What are you doing?
You seem... disturbed.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
You do?
You think about it?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
We gotta play with more bullets.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
That's it. No. No way.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Did you go hunting.
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Well, who'd you get married to?
What the hell's that for?
Up a little there... What would you say?
I think he wants more than your cookies.
My man Dubbs.
Funny guy.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Sir, your limo's here.
You sure?  I can help you.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
You my partner?
I'm ready.
They're going to rob that bank.
I'll inform dispatch.
Wanna come?
How then?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
She's pretty.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You never want to find out.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
You could always take it off.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Jabez -- ?
Belle --
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
But I like the new one better.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Now run along, Daniel.
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
No, no! Give it to me!
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
What -- what's on your mind?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
The only one you missed -- is the President.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
I think his leg is broken.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Your butter money?
Jabez!
I'll get the doctor.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
I want you to fix these fish!
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I can't be honest with them.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
What's happening?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
Nothing...
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Yo!
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
What are you doing?
...I've missed you.						*
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
How do you know?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Is that him?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jenny?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I know!
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah!
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Sonny-boy, one word?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
What the fuck do you want?
You tryin' to fuck me?
Yeah ...
Yeah?
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
The gun's right on your back...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Now, you -- what's your name?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Are you a lawyer?
What is it, Sam?
How did you know your son was involved?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
Goddamn women...
We won't have to.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
I never been up in a plane before.
What?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Bullshit!
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
What's wrong?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Oh - Maria!
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
Did Pop come down?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Of course not ...
And if you can't deliver them?
This is Bishop.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
I've already formulated a plan.
I don't know.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
God help us. God help us all.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
How did you meet Choco?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
How you be?
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Ya back is got.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
So?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
How long?
Squash it.
You're a drunk fool.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Sal's gonna be mad.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Let it be broke.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Do we now?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Why you gotta curse?
What?
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You talk to 'em.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
I didn't know you could read.
Yeah.
That's the dope.
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
O'clock?
HARRY? Are you okay?
What are you wearing?
The name's Walter.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
One day they'll find a cure.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Got any crazy eights?
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
HARRY.
No.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
I didn't know that.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
You're it.
Can he do that?
What?
Who's your partner?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Sure I do. On one condition.
I kinda screwed things up.
You have beautiful eyes.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Captain Rob came back?
A raft.
You're it.
Hey, it's Jessica.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
But my mom gave me the map.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
A float!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So can I come along?
You had some questions.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, leave him alone.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Well, something stinks.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Hey you two. Lights out.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
It's the big potato.
And, take some more pictures.
Knock knock.
It's a surprise.
Where is it?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
This is horse?
What's that you're saying?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Yes, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Man-carved steps.
Stop him yourself.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
But you're a big star!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Let me take you to the hospital.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
You'll be sitting on the right.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
What do you think you're doin'?!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Wow.
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
It's a damn good role.
It takes me comfortable.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, wait!
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Really?!  Well good for you.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
So, Mr. Johnson --
My eyes are killink me.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Lugosi?
OUR picture?
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
The marriage already ended.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Those assholes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
I'm really sorry...
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Wow.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
What do you love her or something?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
What?!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You know what would be great?
Ed, can I see you a second.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
They tore her dress! ...
He's who we want to go with.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Al!
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
How's Marcia? She all right?
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Both.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
She had white shoes.
Eddie...
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
She won't.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
What does this mean?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Why do it?
You do though, you look great.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Go!
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Everybody hates me!
Page three of the Post.
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I'm sorry.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
This is going right up your ass.
Kinda'.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Show business.
I'm making a tape.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Good-bye, brother!
You know what your problem is?
No. Two times.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
We don't have foibles.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Larry?
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
So Tracy?
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Which door?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Shall we give it a name?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
Where 're you going?
But other people can see them too.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Thought what?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
What do you want?
That obvious, huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Yeah, that's Stens.
Dudley.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
What?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
That's right.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Whose shoe?
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Why?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Even I'm not that crazy.
So what's the point?
What's that for?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
What are you going to do?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
What are you talking about?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
No.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Around.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Was it a party?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
I just gave him my card.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
That's who they are.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
Sorry.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
The NSA killed him.
Here?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Pretty fast.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Very good.
What size?
For that matter, I think you will too.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
You should take this seriously.
What do you mean?
He's got his priorities?
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
It wasn't me.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Good.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I was missing you.
Why the hell would I--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
That's temporary.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
This conversation's over.
You're a moron, you know that?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
He's kidding.
Dad!
Where've you been?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
What?
Ssh!
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
I don't know!
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Are you okay?
You think there was a connection to--
It means who's side are you on?
Who?
We'd have to--
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
No thank you.
Now is that clear?
You felt obliged to.
You sing.  All the time.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
This is - what is this?
Arabic?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Why did you hate me?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Shall we be all right?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
I see.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
When's Clifton picking you up?
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Or was it Toronto?
What do you want?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Who are his ghosts?
Oh, all over.
Irving Berlin.
The team is in mourning, darling.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Right.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Are you asleep?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Excuse me -
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
I'm still here.
Kip - come and dance with me
Will you come with me?
It's what I've learned.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Certainly not.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
The windows don't open.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
We've got to catch him in the act.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
Mr. MacDougal.
Seems I am.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
Do you mind?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
The Empress Death Mask.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
You want me to pick up a painting?
Fine. What do I do?
How much am I paying?
Only a week?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
You bought this for me?
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
He wasn't.
Camera in the--
Ready?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Peoples China Bank.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Got it.
So how long till we do this?
That was a lifetime ago.
But would you--would you--
So what are you going to do with your share?
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The key to success is using the right tools.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
You look like George Washington.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
She's calling the shots now.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
My friend, you always surprise me.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Tony Marvin.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Cause of the chromium.
What's chromium?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
I don't even know how much money that is.
And get someone to help around the house.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
All I have is hundreds.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
What are you doing here?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
And you can't?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You think there's more?
What now?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Someone's following me.
I want my fucking money --
I'll see what I can do.
Whoa.  No shit.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
So why would PG&E offer it?
When?  Where?
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
Here what comes?
I wasn't gonna --
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
And you were told to destroy those?
Ross.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Yeah.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
You want my number?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
You're around every afternoon?
Great.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
More than you need me.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Thank you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
Someone stole my stuff.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Wow, that's soon --
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
You must survive, Luke.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Barks at Han.
Barks his consternation.
I have felt it.
I think we're in trouble.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
We?
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
That depends.  Where are we?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
No.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Leia!
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Did you call the Zoo?
Good God.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Zira, are you mad?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Primitive?
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Cuervo...?
I tried...
Give it to me.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
He's... near.
Shit.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Not you?
75% power.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Where is it?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
What are they?
No screamin' shit.
How do we get out of here?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
The freeway.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Arthur.
Perceval, you have returned!
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
You saved me from the arrow...
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
I left it in the tent, sir.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
A lovestruck page!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Here.
Dinner at the White House.
Just five or six people.
Didn't who tell me?
Phonograph.
It's serious?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Would you like some more coffee?
Thank you.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
Morning.
How are you today?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
So, what causes this?
We still think the temporal lobe...
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No, is Regan aware of it?
What did you do today?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Captain who?
Oh I bet he is.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Regan, why are you reading that?
People get tired.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Lieutenant?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Dimmy, you worry for something?
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
Can you give her something?
You're not my mother!!!
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
Who is it?
No.
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
Yeah, come on in.
What're you saying, Charlie?
What's wrong with them?
What do you do to him?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What's the gig?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Cindy.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Yeah?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
Jack.
What are you, crazy?
No.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Hey, Frank.
Yeah.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Have some more wine, Frank.
All night?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
What the hell are you doing?
Really.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
April.
A useless talent.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What disease?
What channels it on?
Jack, you're on television.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What?
Stay off it.
Jack!
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
So what'd you think?
The audience was a little off tonight.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Ready?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
A seven.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Jack, you with us?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
What'd she sing?
Oh yeah?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
I can't sing it anymore.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You miss him, don't you?
Aren't the kids asleep?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
I can keep the beat.
You're upset.
You were good.
Friend.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
What kind?
Vegetables.
Let me get the light.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
You mean if I get sick?
What did he do?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Where am I?
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
And this thing can grow it?
Or reactivated the first one.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
I'm late for surgery.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Castor's escaped!
What happened?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What's that?
You'd have to start immediately.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Rise...and...shine...!
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Trouble at work?
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
C’mon Jack...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
But what do I do?
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
What're you talkin' about?
Evelyn, right?
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
I can't seem to let go of you...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Uh...that baby’s crying...
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I don’t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Are you out of your mind?
Annie goes to a great school.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I promise, Jack...
You look great.
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Damn...damn...damn...
I want to see you again.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I found it!
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
The shields on the station should protect us.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed? ... Sue?
Ben?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
And where do we think we're going?
You're on fire!
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
How's the IPO?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
You said it was urgent.
Please don't make this personal --
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Where do we stand?
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
How bad off is he?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
Right, sir.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Just one, General...
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
Doctor...
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Shouldn't you answer that?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
A surgeon might...
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
Such as?
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
What can we do?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
Doctor, we've just about had it.
You said there was a quick way out!
A what?
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Looks like quite a way to go...
I don't believe that.
I can't tell you.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
The Wall's transparent...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
She started shrieking, you know.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Yah, he -
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Just a general way.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
...Yah, okay...
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
... I'm sorry, sir?
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah.
Where're you going?
Are you calling Stan?
Norstars.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Where is everybody?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
How's it look, Marge?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...What can I get ya?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Linda.
So... they didn't...
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
This is do-able.
There's no one else here.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
We need to talk.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
The dynamite...
It means it was homemade.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
You need to lighten up.
I'm in pain.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
In case we want to switch nights.
What are you doing here?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
No, thanks.
Make sure.
You... don't have to... leave.
When?
That... sawing and hammering.
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
You got about thirty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
What happened... ?
Is this a test, sir?
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
I mean -- for a living.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Insurance'll cover it.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Yeah.
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
The fight.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You're sure?
What is this place?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What the hell ... ?!
This conversation...
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about Marla?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I'm pulling the green wire.
Fuck you.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Tyler...
Damn it!  God-damn it...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
I'm doing this for us.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Robert Paulson?
Would you rather be dead?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
You have to tell us now.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Six duds in a row.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
What's going on here?
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Want me to drive?
What is it?  What are you?
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
That's why I was there last night.
No.
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Police are coming.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Cuticle lacerations.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You mean the snake?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Again.
That's what I'm here for.
You read me, Brewer?
You okay?
What's this?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
How you doing, Brewer?
It's a guy in a cage.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Are they going to torture us?
You're gonna love it.
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
I do?
I know.  I go with you.
What was that?
What's the job?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
It's not necessary.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Will it hurt?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
My parents were divorced.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I'm sorry.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Can I help you?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
How un-sixties of you.
Huh-huh.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Please don't hurt me?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They said you're The One.
A quest?
The Little...
Him...?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
It's such a great song.
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
In a bar called Hellfire.
Beautiful night huh?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
You just going to sit there?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Just finish eating.
Come on.
No. We have tomatoes.
Wasn't it, ladies?
Sorry.
Oh.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Daddy's very ill.
Yeah... I guess so...
Well...  I better let you...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
What questions?
Do you want some gingerbread?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Bye, now.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Nothing.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
You think I'm a fake.
No, don't do that...
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Robert, I think you better just...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
What kind of doggy is that?
I don't think that's true.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Pardon me?
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
What are you doin' here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
That's it?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
How you treat them?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Why?
Fa what?
A bad attitude.
Like this?
Who?
How do I know you're not lying.
Probably.  One of the many.
Hey!
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Maybe tonight?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
Hey you're really nuts.
What? What are you talking about?
Fletch F. Fletch
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Ask anybody.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Mrs. Smith.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
What, the heat here?
You gonna nail the chief?
Are you all right, Doctor?
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Then he has.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Did you say cops?
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
John who?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Alan's in Utah.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm terrified.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I commend him on his choice.
Where is she?
What did you want under the bed?
Fletch.
Who?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Just give me a hint, all right?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I don't know, what was the case?
Hello, Ford...
I came to warn you...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Hey, they blew me.
Let's get serious...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
I tried to help you...!
It's me.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Well, hello, Ford.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
It doesn't have to be like this?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
It's your problem.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Sale boulot.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
It's beautiful.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Yeah!
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Toy wit' this will ya.
What about Sal?
Timezit?
Hey, Bo.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
It looks open on the other side.
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear, Satch.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Deleon.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you say your name was?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What's going on?
That's impossible.
What?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
But that's tomorrow.
She just died, your mother just died?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
How?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
She makes ten.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You used to be on the job?
No kiddin'?
Who are you?
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
What is that?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Who brought up this bright idea?
What're you gonna do?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What was that?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
What's the matter?!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
What's this?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
No.  I got here just before you did.
This is too painful to look at.
See anything?
Bullseye!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I thought that was the end of the song.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
Jason who?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
What's goin' on?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Everything going okay?
Ed...
You're talking about my lady.
That's very colorful, chief.
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
It was a community service.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I've told you the truth.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
That's disgusting.
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
What are you going to do?
Did you hear that?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
But I thought...
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
You have no right...
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What did you do with Rennie??
Can't we at least talk about it?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
So, are you having fun yet?
When did this start?
I heard you weren't coming.
I didn't mean for you to go!
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I used to drive a taxi.
Big mess every time.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Guys ready to order?
Don't talk like that.
Very dangerous.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Is it safe?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
Where are you going?
He'll hate it.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
She died.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
What else?
See, Daddy.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I am really, deeply sorry.
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
What do you want me to do?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
It's the kid's lucky day.
You're charming the boy.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
What do you mean?
Yessiree, Bob.
Yes.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
He wears a disguise.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
I am your wife.
God gave you ten thumbs.
Enough.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
What was he like?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
What do you want?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
It's beautiful.
I would rather march.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
We need your help!
The fools!  Sorry...
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
You're an extraordinary man.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
There are a few million miles to go yet.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
We don't have the manpower.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
German.
It's not too late to back out.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
It's all right.
What makes them think that?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
They'll recognize me.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Were <i>you</i> alone?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Who are they?
What is it?
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
What about them?
I'll take care of my end.
What do you add up to here?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
How's Estelle?
That's not all of it.
I guess I'm kind of...
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
That doesn't hurt.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
What about the bank?
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do you trust him?
I don't want to go there.
There better be a guy with the
Texas is a big state.
When we had trouble before it was different.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
You can't trust anything these days.
Are you hungry?
Okay?
We better stick here till tonight.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Okay.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What now?
That's right.
Where's home?
Hope you get to where you're going.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
What do you have in mind?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Well, he drove it into the river.
How'd it happen, then?
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Where's he living these days?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Do you?
Sid Fletcher.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
He was here for four days.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That must be interesting.
Where you going to live, then?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
What happened to you, then?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Ta.
Is he staying the night?
And what you going to do?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
What you going to do?
You wouldn't.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Did you sleep well?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What's it to you anyway?
Jack! I didn't like that.
Three hundred altogether?
What's that?
Four hundred?
Deadbeats all.
You did?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
That's right?
For some sales pro...
The nurses?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You don't ax your sales force.
You build it!
...you're absolutely right.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
As an idea.
No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Did I say that?
A buck a shot.
He'd give me a job.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Me?
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Can we get some coffee...?
I can't close 'em.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.
The cops?
Will you excuse...
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Shelly: get in the office.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, fella.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...no...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...you talk to Murray...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
John.  John...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Alright.
I wish I could.
Is that what you're saying?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You robbed the office.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Don't.
Why?
You did that?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Shit.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Eight units?
Shelly...!
They took the leads?
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
The monthly interview...?
You're sure?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Rick...?
Yeah.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
What was yesterday?
She wants her money back.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
What?
You hear what I said?
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
What is this, your farewell speech?
They didn't get the contracts.
Aren't you going out today?
...Mr. Williamson...
Why do you have to go?
I can help you.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Is Kay coming?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You would risk your life for strangers?
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Ready, Frankie.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
I never met them.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
That's off now.
Will you tell him?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Me too, Tom?
If you need anything, just...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Was it a boy or a girl?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
How's the baby?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
On a plane back to Sicily.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Are you Klingman?
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
However I can help you...
This doubles my investment.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I just left our friend in Miami.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Trust me; do as I ask.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
What if I say shove it?
Thanks, doll.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
It still hurt.  A lot.
What're you talking about?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Then you're as single as I am.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
You went to university?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
No.  The girl.
Let's get out of this funk hole
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Do you mind?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
So it is going to happen after all.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Just take off the fucking mask!
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
You coming, Boone?
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Mr. Kay, sir.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
You're serious.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
You didn't?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
How are you?
How's the leg?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Fish.
I'm not interested --
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
What's this -- ?
What for?
I guess ...
Got it ...
Diane 1.
Donny --
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
oh.
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
We'll take it...
Sure -
Any more ...
You all right -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Hey, you want something to eat ?
What happened to you?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Come here --
You okay -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
What's with the look?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
"Mitch?"
On account of Mitch?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
No ... ?
What the hell's that -- ?
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
What are you doing... ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
The hard part ...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Okay, then... Otto?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
How old are you now, Toby?
What about me?
How come ... ?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Tell him. It's okay.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What do you do?
My bag. My bag.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Who's gonna do that?
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What about the schools?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Don't worry about it.
Paulie's gonna make him?
You want the melon?
I better call again.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
You ready?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
What?
It's a way outta here.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
What class?
Oh...
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Hi.
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Is this a bad time?
Jesus.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
You want us to give you cash right now?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
--that?--
--That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
What are you smiling at?
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Good to see you.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Yeah.
My kind of background?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Why would he do that?
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
Why there?
Do you know when you'll be back?
How about one now?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Yes, I do.
Watch your mouth.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
They're all dead.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I just want you to know, Sean...
See ya.
You suck.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Five minutes.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
No I wasn't...
You grew up around here?
I bet you have a great family.
Yeah.
How many?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Where have you been?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Then what are you afraid of?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Take care.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ready, Pa?
Twenty days work, oh boy!
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Any gas?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Want to work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
She's settlin'.
Think she'll hold?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
What's the matter?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I didn't mean nothing.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Ma, you sick?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Yeah?
You can have this for ten cents.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Well?
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Now you done it! You busted it!
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
--Stop it--
Bob. Bob Destephano.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
It's always the little things.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Hello...?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Which would you rather...?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Is it something you've done?
I was leaving.
You went to school with these people.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
What do you want?
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Lisbon?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
In Detroit. This weekend.
You have.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
No, I don't have one.
Ten years. What happened!?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
I have a way with animals.
He's beautiful.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
How long did you live here with your wife?
How did you meet her?
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Great!
It's me.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What was I saying?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Yeah, what?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
I'll help you with the coffee.
What was it like?
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Why do you always wear that hat?
Yeah?
Mmm. An editor.
Sure?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
"... and I said that"...
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Welcome to our show!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Shit!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
And what's he do?
How was school?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Shit! Come on!
Yo, showtime, showtime!
That's Razor and Blade.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Here's your class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell are you doing?
Your slave?
And you have to smile.
Kate, listen.
Why did he come to you?
Ready?
I can't believe they decided you won.
Gill.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Hello?
You're welcome.
Colonel who?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Hello, operator services.
What number please?
You're late.
So?
So?
Are you two okay?
Go!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Because the lights are all out.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Four plus Myers.
Now where are you going?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Watch it.
What the hell did this?
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Had enough?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Something?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Sort of.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
I've already lost it.
You still spooked?
Probably Mister Riddle.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Yes, you can.
You locked yourself in.
Want a beer?
Is that all you say?
You have the wrong feeling.
They could be.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
Who is it?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Hello.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
There's nothing else I can do.
Ever done anything like this before?
I couldn't if I tried.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
I love that.  That's my type.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Hmm?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
And it's just in one ear?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Page a hundred and twelve.
How's everything?
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
I thought you weren't coming.
Lee...
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
How do you know?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
How about something to eat?
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Elliot lusts after you.
What's the problem?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Look at this guy.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
So how are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Ohh!
Isn't that great?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, okay.
Uh-huh.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's married...
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
Oh, gosh.
You're too demanding.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Good.
Well--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Well...
No, I am.  I am.
Nobody ever said it.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Right.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Thanks.
Mickey?
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I can't think.
A reward for what?
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
Yes?
Why me?
We could skip the Gavotte.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Evelda Drumgo.
C'mon, pal.
You're ready now.
How crazy is that.
That's right.
What's new onna street?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
...are they hard to get?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Why did he come back?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
He escaped...
He is...?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
I am all attention.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
What is that supposed to mean...?
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
My husband brought it to me from America.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
If your duty requires it.
Yes.  How did you know?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
And?  Then?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Make them eat the figurine.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
You want another drink, honey...?
What's that, Baby?
...what...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
For approval.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Go stand by the flagpole.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...

Fuck off.
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Sorry Veronica.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Veronica, you look like hell.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Good plan.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
Mute!
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
It doesn't work on small animals!
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Answer him dick!
We on tonight man?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
 Got an A, Mum!
He's the manager!
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
Who cares!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm so happy to see you!
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
This.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
I shall call him Diello.
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Poor Father . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Of course, yes.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Pitbull attacks.
Sure plenty of times.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Since what?
Must be nice.
I have my connections
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
You got a drinking problem or what?
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
Nothin'.
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
I... I know that, John...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
What's the matter?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
Any particular brand?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I should.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
About what?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
A man?  Was it a dream?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
I know it's at the high end of our range --
How were we -- were we cool?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear what he said?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How long does it have to be a new house?
He wants to see me!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Just reduced.
God, your sister's really hot.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Do you see a man?
Even better.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
What?
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
You sure?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
France.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
To ask her to dance.
Well?
I'll go first.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why are you doing this?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
You're hurt.
I don't have any answers for you.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
You didn't answer my question.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Why not?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
What now?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
We found him this morning.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
The car.  All you want is the car?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Not if they're looking at something else.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're fucked.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Let me come get him.
He needs a doctor.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Mine, too.
You leave that gun alone!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Where are they?
Is something wrong with Jane?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
He says that his father's hurt.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
It's right in front of us.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
What are you people going to do?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Where are you right now?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Okay.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
I don't know what you're talking about.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Paul!
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
What is this about?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Ten.
Give me it.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Paul, you know who this is?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Excuse me, Colonel.
They fired a rocket at us.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
We must go to the Diplomat.
When?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
Satellite feed.
You fucking see that!
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
The commander is not here.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
How can we help him.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Twelve are dead.
What are you doing?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
All. What do you mean all?
Paul, are you there?
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
What are you playing here, Price?
There must be some other way out.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Thanks.
Why not?
There's always exceptions.
You hear somebody?
What are you looking for?
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Price!!
Don't think it's even an issue.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
...Jesus H. Christ.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Could we have a word?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
-- and who's next on your list?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I'm ready now.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I think...I may have the answer.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
I was upstairs!
Problem where? Looked good to me.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
-- hey! --
Did you find something?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
By freeing them.
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Are we leaving mommy?
H-how long will it take?
She's down.  Help her...
Can I have this room daddy?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Mommy please help me!
Are we going back to California daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Oh come on...
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
What the hell is that?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
The heater's here.
What is it?
Oh come on!
Aubrey!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
I think we should do it.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Your daughter's been taken.
You must be the new tenants.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Why are you so interested?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
But you gave me a rose ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
What ... What ... ?
How do we start?
JP?
Yes. 53
Oh, I don't ...
Yeah right.  Look ...
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
That was beautiful.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Did I miss anything?
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Count of three?
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Welcome back to Vinci.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
And I'll bring my entourage...
Catholic girls are scary...
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Wha--
The C.I. what?  God, no...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
No, let me!
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Thanks for sharing.
Why does this have to be so hard...
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Ol' satchel-butt...
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Confused?
Oh, is that it!
Smitty.
...What happened?
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
What a beautiful thought.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
...You son of a --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
You can't print that!
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Yessir.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...No money.
He don't look wise.
She's good, Bennie.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
But, Mrs. Rand --
She can never be cured?
You're single?
Where were you trained?
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
It is not beautiful.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
A mental case?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I told you.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Benjie!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You're staring at me.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
What do you think?
What?
This just isn't the best moment for this.
You're not going to --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Ready to go?
Elena.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
See you.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
But...
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Good shit.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Forget what?
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Shit. You're not planning --
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Just be careful.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Maybe you should have just a half.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Where you going?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
When worlds collide.
Hello, Charles.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
And?
Right.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
It feels warm.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I don't know. How do I know?
Just after Leland Street.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Who's that?
This murder was in the papers, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Not really.
It's legitimate.
He would have liked that.
No.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
They're all over everybody.
He's just rattling your cage.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
I'm not expecting anyone.
You heard me that time.
I told you I don't remember.
I was her best friend.
Hey...
I don't know.
Oh?
No.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
So you have the answers...
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
We want no quarrel with him.
Are these not the answers you came for?
You didn't even warm them, did you?
I want some more.
But you're the fairest by far.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
You... fed on me?
You both did it?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
It can't be -
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
This is no performance.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You've just done it -
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
As did the one who made me.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Why do you do this Lestat?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
No... You come back to me Louis...
It's just a room...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
Shall we go on?
But why did you tell her?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Your what?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
No means yes.
But, he said he'd try.
Cancer in a box.
Karla!
Be careful, Julie.
I don't know...
I'm holding your hand!
Voodoo.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm sorry.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
To a great weekend --
Ahh, that feels great.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
What's going on?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
Take this.
Where'd Estes go?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I have forgotten it, dear.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
What if he is?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
This girl --
Do you mind if I go with you?
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
I have had command for the last time —-
Daughter -- my daughter --
You're crying. Why?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
What did you say?
You have no car.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
What?
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Well?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
What?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Old college graduate now, huh?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Anything I can do back here?
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
How's that?
I know it's soon to talk about it.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Hey, George . . .
Where are you going?
George, can I see you for a second?
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, I don't.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen.
I'll take it. And then what?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
How's that?
About what?
Where'd you get that dress?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Have fun.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How about that one there?
How fast does this go?
For me...?
Great!  Find one for me.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
The lighthouse?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
Loser sails home alone.
Hey!
What is it?  What's there?
I never heard of a 908.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
What about that camera?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
I'm going.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Wait a minute....
It came up during the meeting.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
What makes you think there might be?
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Sean's awake.
Hey!  That's my boss!
All summer?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What?
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Yeah?  Then what?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
You're not going out right away, are you?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Get a dance yet?
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Anyone know what time it is?
Maybe it's gone.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
The wind drift is lateral.
Give me back my hat!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Hurry, please.
What's the lighthouse?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
You're going sailing.
Wave to my son.
Oh, my God....
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
You called, Doctor?
And what else is bothering you?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
How the hell did it get in here?
Here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I can have them walk backwards.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I will.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Philip.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Hi, Mike.
'Course they're also so rich.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Sure am.
Herpes?
Besides that.
Yes, it's great!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
You'll spoil her.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
It sure is good to be home....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Make a list.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
How come it's my responsibility?
Turn it off....
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
Henny Youngman....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
The fish.  Check it....
Don't be late.
I like Grandma's cooking....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I almost forgot....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
You hungry?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I don't know how....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
What's wrong?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
What happened?
Yeah....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
How many...?
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long?
Who?
Half don't...Bring her about....
We lost it....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Shove it....
You told me what?
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
That bad, huh?
Did you like that, Mama?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Be my guest. What you got?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
What does that mean?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
We're going.
Why?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Ease off, John ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Listen, you don't havta come?
How do you know her hair's black?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Is this normal?
Did he get you the job?
Vehicle references.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Yes, Sir.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Can I see your hands?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
What are you reading?
No.
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
You know? How do you know?
Why?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
You think he still loves her?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
I just heard.
I have to finish my job --
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
No no...
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Oh my God.
Too bad.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe you should call her.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Forgot your keys --
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Not right now, Jerry.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Beautiful.
Thanks for coming.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
You...
Jerry --
They do, my brother.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
You look good.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What did you say?
Young adult.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
What?...WHAT!?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
He could have died.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
You rented an automated litter box.
We need to keep moving.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Eric, your parents are both here.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Bonitas.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Hmmm.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Billy!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
It matches the pictures.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Oh --
But he's the head of InGen!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What are you guys gonna do?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Where do you think you're going?!
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Ian.  It's guano.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Ask her.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
What?  No menthol?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
They are?  I'll be damned.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
And what are those?
The movement!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
C'mon on, this way.
It's all right.
No.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Hola, Juanito
Why not?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Tim.
Straight-A brainiac!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
You're married?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Ah - - they're here.
He left us!  He left us!
What's that?
Watch how it eats!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
No, but...
Mister Biller?
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
Hello?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Two.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
What's going on?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
Are you going to plead insanity?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Well?
Oh?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Uh-huh...
See this?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
You saw him?
What are you doing?
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
No, sir.
-- Eduard --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Was he depressed?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
... Why take me into your confidence?
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
It's gone out so quickly?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
All these in the last year?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
I could always apply there.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
Oskar!
This is filed incorrectly!
Then that's the place for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's a light up ahead.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Give it back!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
Man Eater!!!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
They were just tasting the berries.
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Why? She's a junkie.
Sure dear, yes.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Guess!
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Why isn't he locked up?
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
You said that.
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Can't you get him?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What's the matter?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Mm.
You wanted to, or you are?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Where, how?
Some mistake perhaps that --
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
What?
I can't follow you.
John, how are you?
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Think this is our guy?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
What do you like best about her?
What do you like best about your daddy?
Uh, huh...
Okay...Same as usual...
Yeah?
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Daddy?
Is this really your desk?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
How long was that?
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
'Night, Jim.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
And?
What?
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
I'll take my chances.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What are you going to do?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're sure?
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
California?
You heard anything yet?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
I will buy them for you.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
And the United Nations? Surely?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Holiness?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
How big is Tibet's army?
Where is Alsace?
Tell me.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain chooses not to.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
I am scared.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Do you think I must?
What does the butter spot feel like?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
We have enemies.
You have grown up very good.
Tell me.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
It seems like we're getting lower.
Why are we landing?
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We'd only just met.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Excuse me?
What?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Baby crocs?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
No thanks.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well.  Goodnight.
What?
It can't work.
He's mooing.
We gotta get to Hector!!
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Are they feeding?
He just came up screaming.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Hey!!
With what?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Hank!
Kelly.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Hey.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Sorry?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No. He won't come after me.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
On what basis would they reject him?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Thank you, Clarice.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Yes... I did.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
My God, you've grown up.
Yes, miss.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Your "father"?
Much further?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
My letter...
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Fort Edward, then?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Will you men help us stop the French?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
What a place for them...
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Qui vive?
And?
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What happened?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
Getting some food.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Clear for pickup.
The shack...
It saw us!
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
How much did you part with?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Yes?
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
You all right back there, mate?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
So do you know these geezers well?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what's going on?
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
That's if I want to see you.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
You jerk--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Do whatever they tell you--
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Nice job.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
My mother said he never asked about--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
PDA?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I have a B average.
Homework?
How's your room shaping up?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Something like that.
This place is a gold mine.
What?
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Mikey--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
Black Seminoles?
You get much of that in here?
This is an official visit, then--
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
I thought you were married!
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Tell that one, Hollis--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That's a matter of interpretation--
That so?
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I haven't been out here for a while.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I got an idea what happened.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
There must have been somebody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
No. Is he sick?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
What about it?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
What?
What's she singing about?
Can I get this?
How come?
Morning, Sheriff.
Murdered him?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I should get back.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
Like your story is over.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
Yeah?
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Thanks, Billy.
How'd you spell that again?
Who did this?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Death.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
He's with us...
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
He's a secretive man.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
You don't believe me.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
Stuff?
You said you weren't with him for love.
Yes.
What was that?
Valentin?
What about me?
... they believe you.
And this Butterfield guy--
You believe that?
They weren't worth a damn.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
What are you, my mother?
Whose is the car?
What's the difference?
Why'd you come here?
Him too.
Hold on.
The Puritan?
Where'd you learn that?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
Look, Ma, no wires.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
What is?
Nix! Nix!
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
What about you? Why are you here?
I'm thinking about it.
What do you do?
Oh, what do you do with that?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Did I scowl at you?
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I'm going to miss you.
Why can't it last?
You're leaving right now?
Well... have a good flight.
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Do you like massage?
My stockings.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
Uh, no.
When are you coming home?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, the record company sent these...
It's amazing  there!
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I spaced out.
What?  That's horrible!
I'm still shaking.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Seemed...on edge.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
You'll do it?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Oh my God!
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
What's that got to do with you?
What do you mean?
And the point is?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
I don't understand what's going on.
Yes, I know.
So what?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
You okay?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
No oxygen to the brain.
What about after?
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
How much time do we have?
Oh, Peter.
Good seeing you again.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
You don't want to face it.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
Yeah.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
He could see me.
What's up?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Taste this.
So what do I do?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Which one for tomorrow?
Okay.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
I can take it.
What?
Careful.
That was nice.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
They ever love you back?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up?
But?
Well, what do you know.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So...does it hurt?
So how come you could play basketball?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I want to ride my own bike.
What?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Guess not.
Mulholland Drive.
Why?
Four.
What was that about?
Clothes.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Who was that?
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
You weren't at my game.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
What?
You're what?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
You visiting?
It just isn't.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
I heard enough.
One game.  One-on-one.
You're out of your mind.
What will this prove?
So?
And what happens when you lose?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Not great.
What?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
You scared me.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
So what are you gonna do?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
From your mouth.
Look, I'm busy.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What kind of Cancer?
It was scary though.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
For what?
Yeah, but I don't know --
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
What are you lookin' for?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
You take cream or sugar?
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Eight o'clock?
Why not?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
It's ok.
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
C'mon guys, settle down --
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
I have love.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
You see?
I'm sick.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
...please...
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Braces?
He has Phil right now.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Jack.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
the valley?
Does you mother still work?
I'm sorry.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
It's not your given name, right?
They wouldn't?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
You're just come in --
You're here.
No I Said.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Been drinkin' today?
--- What was that?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
...you know...
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
What happend to you?
I can't fuckin' do this.
What were you saying, Stanley?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
You're my handsome man.
No.  No.
Who?
Two years...three years...
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
...say it, Jimmy...
No.
She's asleep.
I'm sorry.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
You don't want any water?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
What would you like?
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Wh-- Wha--
It can.  I know the way.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
And people close to him, who --
Now.  You were saying?
He seeks redemption.
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
But -- are you sure?
It's been too long.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Recent hours have been a shock.
What is that?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
A personal nature?
Betrothed?  I think not.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Silence!  I order you!
Food, moron.
What number did you tear out?
Did they kill him?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
What can I do for you?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Every step of the way.
You mind if I ride with you?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What did the six-toes have to say?
Find out for me.
Let's roll -
Well don't you think that's odd?
Are you alright?
I was just having a little fun -
Something I don't already know?
Mind if I turn out the light?
You always carry a gun with you?
Why did you set me up?
What exactly did you see?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
No...
And?...
I've got a better idea...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
Donut?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
In thirty-five minutes.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Where?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Why not?
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Get him to Atlanta.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Run it.
Get me a plane...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
That's why the boltcutter.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It's getting late and...
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
I'll take you.
Is that you. D?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you see?
Are you a man?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
It's Will Graham...
Linda King's desk.
Okay.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
He asked how you are.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Can you quit?
Is Crawford going with you?
Hello.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
That's right.
Lt. Fisk said...
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Are you gonna kill him?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
Yes.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
No.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
They're having a laugh...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
My hair is coming out.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but I have them.
Right...
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why Memphis?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
You're NOT DYING!
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
I was very original!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
That was a really hot house!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Is he in his room?
Why is he saying these things?!
Sure...
You don't know.
You're two hours late.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
There's something about him, isn't there?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Is that...?
Operator.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I got a fibrillation!
Hello?
Morpheus...
How?!
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Do you still want to meet?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
How did I beat you?
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
And she knows what?  Everything?
She helped you?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Did you believe in them too?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
How is he?
Now left and that's it in front of you.
We need an exit.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Yeah.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
What's funny?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
That was a long time ago.
How did you do that?
Get this thing out of me!
Is it?
Are you all right?
What happened?
What are you doing?
What?
Are you all right?
Holy shit!
How?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Know where he is?
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Yeah.
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Who's the girl?
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
You got some mouth!
What happened to you Flash?
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
What do you mean?
Hey...you got nothing here.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
I think we should see your uncle.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Nope...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Well, maybe you missed something?
"Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Take your time.  I don't care.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
I hate parties --
I don't like cake.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
...This shit's not bad.
What are you eating.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Drew, you're out of line.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
We have an arrangement now.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
'Yes'.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Shall we adjourn?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Mind if I throw up?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
But I didn't mean to do it!
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
'Big'?
Yes?
How long have you been standing there?
Where are you going?
I love your smell.
Did you like making love to me?
Well -- I --
But there's so much to tell you --
I - uh --
That's it?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
When you go, I go.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Bill --
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
About Susan?
Hello, Bill.
What the hell do you care?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
So that's what love is?
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
I don't like what you're saying.
He is --
Yes.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
I think you know --
What do you mean?!
About what?
'Take me'...?  Where?
'The one' to do what?
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Good morning, Dad.
Not my birthday again?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
What?!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
That was wonderful.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
This is crazy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I've got to go --
...We know so little about each other.

Burt.
Amnesia?
So you're holding my calls?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
Do you remember me?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Why?
You know him?
How do I know he did that to you?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Such as?
It's not easy to be calm when -
His name was Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What's wrong?
Neither do I.
I'm not.
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
A BEER, please.
There's a dress code?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
How can you read that again?
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
What the hell you want to go there for?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Who?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
Natalie? Natalie who?
We've got to get him out of here.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So was he scared?
What do you mean "bad news"?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Happy now?
What sort of questions?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
How'd you know I was in here?
Envelopes?							    *
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
I should kill you.							 *
What cop?
No.  I was in Namibia...
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Sal Maguda.
Oh, yeah...
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Where's that?
How's he not your husband?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
You know how improbable this is...?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Is it December?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I forgot the napkins.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
If they attack you...
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Yeah.
Packaging?
What's our deal?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Anything?
What do we got?
Where?
Verdado where?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
I am asking.  You to me.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Hello?
Detective Crockett.
So what do you want?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Yeah.
They had me from the gate.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You mean with the flowers...?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Equipment?
What the hell did you do?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
You got a comb?
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Get lost.
Getchmis olsun
Looks like a cheap hotel.
The kids? Why are they...
Tunnel?
To what?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where you staying, Dad?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
Sixty Lira?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
And you?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
What?
Never was anybody like you...
Billy, what's the matter?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
His name?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
He was just doing his job.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
Hello.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Oh, my!
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
Here.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
What's it about?
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Done?
See, isn't this nice?
Misery's Return?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
What things?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yes.
People sure like those Misery books.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Hey, Pete.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Marcia, please.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
There she is.  I got visual.
How're we doin', then?
What can we do' mate?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I don't.  No exactly.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
..I'm fine..and you?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You have Bellerophon.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
To friends.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
But why tell us?
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
You knew about Jim?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Donít Jim.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
I didn't say that.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
What are you going to do?
Claire.
Whoís dead?
Yes.
No sir.
What?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Kittridge.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Why, may I ask?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
What was your deal with Job?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Claire.
Give me the God damn gum.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
I guess.
Why not?
How was Chicago?
He won't be back in a hurry?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
What's going on?
Try it again.
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Uh-huh
I don't like him.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You're not sleepy?
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
You're married.
You're my father.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Loretta. What's that smell?
Fast.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You don't know nothing about it.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
What about Johnny?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
Alright.
Hi.
Thank you!
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm really afraid.
Ronny!
No, I'll tell him.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
You never have dessert.
Yes, on the floor.
Then let's set the date.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
WHAT?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
Will you live here?
So we'll sell the house.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
Your hair's different.
WHAT!! She was dying!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
What about the moon?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Nerves.
I guess you can't invite me in?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
He's a plumber.
Rita. Rita.
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
She's got it.
Burn them.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Well, who is your lord?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
The same!
Oh!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
What word?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Stop that.
Come Here.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
What with?
There!  Look!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Look, you're a busy man ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Well?
Exactly.  So... logically ...
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Don't be such a baby.
Well taken, Concorde!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
Herbert.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Well ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
Sir Gawain.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
They're all saying the word ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
How much?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Good man.  And is she all right?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
I wish to see my mother.
Convey her a message.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
No.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
You sent for me.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
Oh.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
They don't see it.
And the pony?
I am told so.
They're ready now.
We took a nip of whiskey.
What is it, John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Ma'am?
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
I came as quickly as I could.
Is that not enough?
This is my good John Brown.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
We're going to lose.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
A fine choice, sir.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Why?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Read it.
Who told them that?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Maybe he's not dead.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Happy?
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Where to now?
Then leave her.
SLIP-STREAM.
What are you looking for?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Our time's up.
What is it?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
"Escape"?
So what do you think?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
It means she's screwed up.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Beautiful night.
Yes...what is it?
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
You're still here?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Number 17.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
I think I've been hurt.
Mulholland Drive.
There's nothing?
Strange to be calling yourself.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"Really?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Rita... I know what you're doing.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Good morning. What do you have today ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Where are we ?
Why should we trust you ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So where does this lead ?
First Bank ? But how ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
What's the trick here ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I wanted to let his family know....
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
I don't get it.
Just stop it. End it here.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
I thought you made this place ?
Be very, very quiet...
You okay ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Don't eat at the console.
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
What's wrong ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Well ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Bruce has just awaken.
We can't afford too many surprises.
Will he make it out ?
Look ! Look !
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
What the ... ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Are you okay ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
He was right behind me !
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
There's still a big spot on the floor.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
No nuns, got it.
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
What happened to Shelly?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
What're you saying?
Sure am, who are you?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Hi.
Hi.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
Hi there...can I help you?
Your mother?
But we made a business deal.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Don't wake up Vada.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Getting off please.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Care for a smoke?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
No?
What's it for?
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Committed?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I should do this myself.
He was caressing.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Really?
Beidermeyer?
He's a great poet.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
You're such a baby.
Can't you see it?
They're dead?
Uh huh?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Hi.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I had a good time tonight.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Dance with me?
This is where we are.
I ahh, better go.
Can we see it from the back yard?
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Are they ready yet?
When?
When??
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
What was my mama like?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Hi.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Do you like her?
Why?
My Dad was funny?
Shut your big fat mouth!
He won't give it to me.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
What are they about?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Where's Daddy?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Thomas J?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Where's your bike?
Hey look at this!
Who's that with your Dad?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Woah!!
Run faster they're after us!!
Hi Vada.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Why are you running away?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You can come to my house for dinner?
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Like this?
Just do it.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Neosporin?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
But he always says...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, you're a little early...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Please come, please.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
Will she like it?
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Maybe it's happy there.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What?
I hate that music.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You have to what?
Barnett?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
You going today?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Yes.
Where'd he ever see us?
Bastard
President?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Where are you going?
Come on. He's a crook.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
You got a place to stay?
Fungus?
Bye.
Do you ever do any writing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yes.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Oh, no.
Where's Bill?
Pleasure
He is to a lot of people.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Hasn't it?
Looked like an interview to me.
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Yes.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was what worth it?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Tell me about the purity.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
I could go for a Coke.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Where's it parked?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Just wait one fucking minute.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I admire them.
Through the power of the simple word---
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Only on a much grander scale.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Give her a beer.
It sure is.
'You Duff Anderson?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Want to keep your job, boy?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
You working?
Yes, aren't you?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
How d'you mean?
Let's go, Duff.
Not here, Duff.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Goin' to see my kid.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
Don't push me, Duff.
Don't deny me, Duff.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I don't think that'll happen.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
How about a drink?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
I asked you somethin', boy!
Seems a little loose!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often is that?
Come back some other time, will you?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
They'll run you out.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
No. Why?
Let's go.
Your Raoul?
Omar--
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What are you doing in here?
Easy...
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
What are you talking about?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
What elders?
She's ready to go.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Who got you into this?
What?
Yo.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
You're late.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
What about before that?
Holy shit...
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
...Feels like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
Yeah... fine.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Shit...
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
What?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
No Roger from op/ed?
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
You don't think I can do it.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Now this is cute.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Hi!
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He is totally crunching on you.
How many times have I fired her?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
A--flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Do you even know these kids?
Gus?
That's your story!
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Better person than I.
Josie Grossie.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
You're twenty-three years old!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
Into our group.
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
Yes.
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Why not?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
What?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Yeah?
It's gone now.
You want to talk about it?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Hi.
'Morning.
Jess?
Hi, guys.
We're going up to bed now.
I'm sure you would.
I'll need to take her things.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Jennifer --
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Max, where's Kristen?
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Just until we get things under control.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Take us there, Kristen.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Who is he?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
We're here.
I'm in.
God, that's an enormous arse.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
And then I... right.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Coffee?
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Busy tomorrow?
I have thought about you.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Well...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Can I stay a bit longer?
How are you doing?
I thought I'd give it to you.
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Yes...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Excuse me.
What does it say?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yes.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
That's nice.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
What happened?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
I'll see what I can do.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I agree.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Well, fire away.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
I suppose so.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Max.  This is Anna.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Buggered?
Does she know you're coming?
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Right.  No one else?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Yes.
Spike!
I wouldn't go outside.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Which floor?
Bad news.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
I'm not finished yet.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Welcome back.
I hope everything is settled.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
So long, kid.
So long suckers.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Yeah, kid?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Yeah, where we going?
What? What?
Neither do I...
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Did to me?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
So why are you talking to him?
I'm busting outta this place.
Don't you have any clubs?
Yeah, buddy?
Bet a nickel!
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Right!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
How are you feeling?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
You look pretty healthy to me.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Somebody's coming!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Hi.
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
Your mother.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
What?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
To the foot doctor.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
So?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Hi, Peter.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
You were saying...
How about music?  You like classical?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
There's no such thing.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Very funny.
Really?...
Hello.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Excuse me?
What looks good?
How about the other one?  His friend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
But what?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Your brother?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
What did you say to her?
That was really sweet...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
What the hell!!!
I can get home all right from here—
The moment I saw you.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Now what are you doing?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You haven't finished your beer.
What are you crying for?
Edie!
Pigeons... .
Terry— what's happening to you?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
I want to see you, Terry.
This is my business.
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Terry?  What do you want?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Listen— Nolan—
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What do you mean?
Those creatures..!
You do?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
The time...is short.
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
You better hope there is.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What're you talking about?
Glenn Michaels.
Lie face down on the floor.
Did you know that when you married him?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Where in the hell are we?
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Now that's a really big house.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You find out?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You ever wear one of these?
They look like plain old rocks.
Hello, Daniel.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Sure, Daniel.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
Yeah, why?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Ironic, isn't it?
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Karen, I told you not to--
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
The fuck you talking about?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Good luck, Richard.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
How many was that?
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Is that how you think of yourself?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You were going to see her?
So she did help you?
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Thanks for your help.
Really?
It's a little late for me.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Foley?  That you?
Have they got Midge up there?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
Meaning?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
That was some shit, huh?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Flyweight.
I'm looking for Maurice.
You like to sit down?
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
It's beautiful.
Technically.  They're separated.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
I really gotta go.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
He doesn't even look like that.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Midge.
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Nervous?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Sorry.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
You hear my okay?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Sorry.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Oh, this is Betty.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
What?...
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Lucky lady. Hi.
And we're here on the couch...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Looking good out there.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Where did you get that sweater?
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, let's make love.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
What do you know about classical music?
Charlie. About last nights..
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But what has to be different?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Just take a look at it. 
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I thought you were...for a while.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Hello, Charlie.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Terry! Slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
You don't?
Coffee and a donut.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
For me?
Quiet today?
The hat business is in trouble.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh no!
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
Does everybody have to hear?
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Hi, Richard.
Like what?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What will they be made of?
Will you take of f your blouse?
What's the matter?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Who was that?
So where're we going?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
What in God's name... ?
Thanks, you guys.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Fuck you.
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
What's that mean?!
Innocuous?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Thanks for your time.
Who'd you get?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
What do you want?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Beckett?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
What kind of movies do they show there?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Yes.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
No. I can't really see it.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Mom?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Leave that.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Great.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Lots.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Don't know, Joe.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Don't wanna miss this.
Oh, Lord....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Bottle-count.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
But I just wanted to say --
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
There....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
What, switch what?
Hey.
S'matter?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Owens!
I don't suppose....
Hasan?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Suleiman!
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Well, what's it look like now?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Do you have to work tonight?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
'I am not a missing link.'
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
ThatÕs a lie!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
No.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Of course.
Tell him to pull back!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Are you going to take her with you?
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
It's humiliating.
He's moving his fingers!
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Bunker...
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
So what's the problem?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Fuck this shit!
I was wrong.
And you, do you believe?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
What are you talking about! 
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
What's the matter?
Okay. You win.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
And do you amuse the guests?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
How did you meet him?
Certainly not to me.
Cold?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
In a way.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
If I understand what you meant by that.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
They call me Jeff.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
What'll you have, Margo?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
Who told you my name?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Thank you.
Where?
How about a cup of coffee?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You'd be breaking the law.
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
You in charge here?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Where's the shell?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I never saw it before.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
So far.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
Shall we go?
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Good.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Damn.  They're early.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Not here.
Blasé and epicene.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Bastard.
Now, top secret file.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Hello.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Ah, Susy, it...
Friends of yours, huh?
What's their program?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
What's this?
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Where's Roach?
Why should I?
Wild ride, huh?
You never were...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
How was the beach?
Surf conditions okay?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
They don't go for the vault?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Got it.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
The hell are they?!
I know where they're going.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
This gonna take long?
Meaning you were expendable.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Those are cold.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Mmmnnn...?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
It's... it's not like that.
Who are you going after next, sir?
I... I would take advantage of it.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
No, you look like a hooker.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
What do you like?
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
No?  Why's that?
By breaking up a company's assets --
Where'd you learn to do this?
But you want days too.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
You liked the guy, though.
Real genuine guy.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What if I lose it?
I've never been on a plane before.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
You're packing.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Edward, did you hear me?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
What!?
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Couple a hours.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Would you like to try it on?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
You don't believe me?
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I killed him myself.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
But how can you be sure?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
We did it.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Why should that make such a difference?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Probably he means no harm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
You've been mostly dead all day.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Westley's only faking, right?
Who gets Humperdinck?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
Yellin.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Where's Fezzik?
No.
-- all that I have and more please --
Sixty-five.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Humiliations galore!
Slow going?
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Kill me quickly.
Making sure nobody's following us.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
You're that smart?
Yes.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Bye-bye, boys.
You feeling any better?
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Here, don't panic.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
It won't run a week!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Vaaaat???
Not.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Nietzche...
The Blue Max...
Okay.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
You out to buy a motel?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Of course not.
What's your interest?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
I don't know.
Casharoonie!
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Were there any calls?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Yes.
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Is something wrong?
Here?
Where?
What's the matter?
What thing could we be in together?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
It's been three.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
He didn't come back here?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
What?
We could laze around here a while longer.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I can come down next week.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You're very... kind.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Is there?
I'll take you to...
It isn't necessary.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
My mother is not dead!
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Yes.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
No mother.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
How do you do.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it now?
Did you hear?
The child!
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Why didn't you eat last night?
I think so.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
But it was really my fault.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
What!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
No kiddin'?
That's what I said.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
No kiddin'.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
He might get some publicity out of it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
But I have some friends waiting.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I'd know him anywhere.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
What was her name?
Could we go somewhere?
A place you've never been.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
They're filthy, Mother.
But who were they?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
I got an awful toothache.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Neither do I.
Yeah, I know.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He kissed her.
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
No, Mother, he's lying...
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Are they polar bears, too?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
I am ahead of you.
Of course.
How goes it, darlin'?
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Well, she's back.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
How is she?
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Strange voices, Rose?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Took your time gettin' here.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
What's the matter with him?
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Rose, you don't have to.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
How much?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
That's them trying to kill us.
When you planning to cut back on that?
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
What about him?
Where we going?
Birth control's important.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
It doesn't say that.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
General Jim Beam, then.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Pure horse.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
What the hell's his problem?
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Yes, my Master.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Vader's on that ship.
Hey!
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I'm sorry.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Good luck.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Here we go again.
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
All wings report in.
I'm going in.
Over there! Two more of them!
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Well, I'm sorry.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Yes Brad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
You did right.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Who's Eddie?
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
I thought it might be cute.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Paulie, please --
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
He won't last one round.
No doctor!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
This a con?
Few minutes?
Six!
Cost ya a buck.
Here -- Three minutes.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
What about for food an' stuff?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Ya still light seventy.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
I feel bad about walkin'.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
I'm sure you are.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did you hear what I said?
...Screw you.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
The legs must be goin'.
...Who'd ya fight?
Rice is a bum.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
How 'bout a glass of water?
...What?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Please, kid.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Don't you care what the people will say?
How you holdin' up, kid?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya always in a bad mood --
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
...I can't haul meat no more.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
So where is it?
Hold on a second.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
[Within] Juliet!
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Why, may one ask?
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Meaning, to court'sy.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Nurse.
We kept it...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
What in bloody hell is going on?
About time!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Now, what did we steal?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
It's quite satifactory.
I'd stake my reputation.
Where's the case?
Do you have it?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
And more importantly --
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
Sent it where?
Is it done?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Then I guess we're set.
Nobody's going to do that!
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Same thing, isn't it?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
I've seen a lot of people die before.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
You were behind the door?
You would have done that?
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
Give me a cigarette.
Time to quit.
Because I don't walk away.
I know.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What's the story?
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Sort of!
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Damn.
Ready to roll, partner?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
What the hell...
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Well someone's gonna find them.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
It's the right thing to do.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
I can't do that.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Yeah.
OK.
OK.  I love you.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Test the product?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
And what's that?
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
Uh, no...
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Hello.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Shopping here?
A lot of men come in here?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
About what?
What are you saying?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Whatever...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
How's work?
That's great Earl!
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
Well I don't know --
Not in the trunk.
Yeah.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
What the hell is that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Winner!  Four, winner!
I got my sources.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Oh, you American?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
What'd I say?
Hello.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
You're not very good at this, are you?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
It sounds impossible --
Who?
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
No.  It was my singing.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Are you okay?
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
Yes.  We have heaven.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Hello, Benjamin.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
That your gate down there?
What is this?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Help me Rhonda.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
What?
You like it?
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
What?!
Oh no.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
How'd what go?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Jesus...what do you want?
How about a lift home?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Where do we find him?
Hello.
Hello.
He is very good.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
Yes.
See you at the wedding.
Really?
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Getting nervous?
You're going to be very disappointed.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Too much.
Five hundred.
I think so.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I'll have the same.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Where did you disappear to?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
It's fun!  It's high.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Does it matter?
Yes, I did.
You were not.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
What happened at the luau?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
A harmless joke.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Is that all right with you?
Happy New Year, darling.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You okay?
You should write something about this.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
He lost all the weight... there.
Can too.
Men never get this movie.
What?
What?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
It's a sign --
I love the symphony.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
Sure you do.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why not?
Is he home right now?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
It is not --
Hey, my plate is full.
Not.
No, I'm not, but --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Like do you believe in heaven?
This is a good letter, Dad.
Listen to this --
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Have you seen my wallet?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Did too.
No.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Yes?
You're kidding --
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You're welcome to one.
Mornin'.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
How goes it?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Are you sick, Mama?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
A meeting?
Alone?
You mean you're ready to give up?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Bobby?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Ride 'em cowboy)
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Fuck you.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
: What are you up to?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
What's wrong, Danny?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Finland is a country.
I'm hurting.
Fuuuuuck
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Can I ask you something?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Okay
Why?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
You don't understand.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I'm sorry?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
I've got a hot one.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
You've got no choice.
That's because he doesn't have one.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Turns out he's connected.
He knows somebody ratted him.
Jimmy?
What's on the other end of this thing?
What's that smell?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
My sentiments exactly.
Where's Bubba?
Casualties?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
As a matter of fact, I am.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
Upham?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
What about the company?
Fresh out.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
You think they'll be alright?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Up.  We're moving out.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Shit, sir.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
You think he really believed it?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
Lloyd?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Please?
Alright.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Visit her at the home.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
What?
Tell me, is it bad news?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Lloyd?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
That's right, work it out.
You will?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Well...
What are these?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Have a good sleep.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Okay, bye.
Yes.
It's okay, everybody does that.
No.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, what did we just decide?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Then don't do it.
You do?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
It's your castle, man.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Yeah.
PAIN!
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Lloyd.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man.
Later for you, Luke.
You know what, you'd like her.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
When?
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
What's that?
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
God bless you, sir.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
That'd be fine.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
I can do it, Captain.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Outside.
Yes.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
Fair enough.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
But you’ll never get away with it.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
About what?
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
So we found a compromise.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Yeah?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
They're roomates.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
Dewey?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
What do you want from me?
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Knock yourself out.
Time to change numbers again?
What about rehearsal?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
She's not here right now.
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
What are you talking about?
What was that?
Do you work for her now?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Yeah.
Where are you?
Can I help you?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Four? There are five.
Are you sure?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
What about me?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Sidney, what happened?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Basements creep me out.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
I know!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
You're dead!
WHERE?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Duh... that's quick.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
She can't get both of us.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
You know that's not true.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So...
Who did you call?
NO! Don't believe him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Popcorn.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
Is this some kind of a joke?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Please don't hurt him.
No... please.
But you're doing so well.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Did you reach my Dad?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
You girls ready.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
About thirty seconds.
How's the book?
I'm not here to fight.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
I have no idea.
Are you alone in the house?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Stu was with me last night.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
So what's his reason?
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
You've left unfinished business before.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
How you feeling?
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
I don't believe it.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
A woman...
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
You just met me.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Same color and texture.
It could be nothing.
It's my wife.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Does this make it with you?
And?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
We don't know for sure...
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
This is a waste of time.
Are you alright?
Think about it...
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Stay with him.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
How long have you lived here?
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
You ain't goin'...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Well, the reward still stands...
Talk!
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
What you want me to call you?
Nothing for you to see.
Easy on that!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
I think maybe we oughta...
Lemme alone...
They'll be back...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
She's not a little girl any more.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
They never find that girl.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Might at least have left me my pants!
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Hey... the fuse.
Where are you going?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Where have you been all day?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Who's that?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
I really hate to bother him, but...
No, I've never seen him before.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Mrs. Straub!
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Twenty-three, to be exact.
You did not like the speech?
Oh
Ah
Oh…what have I done?
Do you know that house?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
What is the chief part?
The title?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
How long has it been?
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
How?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
No Juliet?!
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Where are you going?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
We are lost.
How will it?
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
"I know not."
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
My lady!
Oh but why "alas?"
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
You can bring them with a word.
And that was only my first try.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But all ends well.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Wait there.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
How do I offend, my lord?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Is there a man?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
So who's going to do it?
You know what I'm talking about.
Finished.
What's the problem?
How much?
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Well?
No. Why should it?
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
Just one thing.
That's right.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
And you like it?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yes.
Did you know --
Well, she had problems --
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- instead of what he is --
The man we know and love.
David hasn't seen him either.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I don't see the point in that.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
Are you all right?
Is this where no one stays?
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
I'm sorry.
Eh, I don't know.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
What guy that died?
Here?.
It's nice.
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
It was some guy called Brian.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
And he's a patient of yours?
For what?
I write about it?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Same as everyone else.
I don't know, I think...
I thought you were in a good mood.
What're you talking about, George?
Do you think George is a fairy?
That's George.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
We cannot go into this later.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
Wow.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
I know.
You here to see my mother?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Did you hear me?
I asked you first.
Well, are you?
No kidding.
Yeah...
How is she?
Wonderful woman.
What sort of references do you have?
You do it.
How long you had this?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
George... how about Felicia?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Don't do it.
What are you looking at?
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Why?
Look about last night --
So I'm saying it...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
I have to see you.
Call me!
There were some shots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
George?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Television or movies?
Baby, don't do this --
... well I'm glad you told me.
I wish you'd go now.
George, now cut this out.
George...
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
All night.
I wanna hear about it, George.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Have a drink.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Come on by.
No you won't.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Hi, Leonard.
Fine.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
-- Yeah, honey...
What?
He does?
-- Yesss?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Good for you.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Are you married?
Do you have something against traveling?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
No of course not.
Call me Les.
How's it going, Doc?
Yes.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Mommy!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Oh,
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
It's okay, really.
Sure.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
No.
Who?
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
It's good to see you.
Hi, babe.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Jack!
I don't know.
As soon as possible.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me,
Stop it!
I'll bring back a doctor.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
five months of peace is just what I want.
can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
I'd better collect my family first.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Hi.
What time does the plane leave?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
The moon's not down yet...
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Went shopping. Why?
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Huh?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Well... was it a prescription?
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
LET THY SPIRIT
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
What?
You bastard!
No... it's fine.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Oh, girls.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
That machine.
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
What is it, Mary?
Like this place?
What?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
A cigarette?
Three years.  A rookie.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Mary Clarence!
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
What?
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Sit down.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Is this all the food I get?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
I got it.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
No nothing.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
What're you doing?
Then one day they find you.
We're looking for Mike.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
You didn't shoot!
A sweater.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We've got to save her!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But, Bishop...
She's a nun, Vince.
Where?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
What the hell are you doing?
He is a behemoth.
Stains of blood.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
May we look at them now?
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
What good is this?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What now?  Where is she?
Why... why are you like this?
Climb up!
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
And this gives worth to butchery?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Where are we going?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Go home.
She is guilty.
She has confessed.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Well, what did you want?
Did you decide, sir?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
How come?
How do you know?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Maybe they needed it.
You want to go with me?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
You all right, Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I'm ye boy.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Karl, you up?
You scared me.
Thank ye.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Where will he go?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Like me, too.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Jesus, what happened to you?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What about for you?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
A photographer ...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, man, good to see you.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
You usually get two.
Anything good?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
What's this?
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Does it hurt?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
No thank you.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
I figured he had a right to know.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
You going to sit here all day?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Yeah, it might be.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Fries?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Now, Mister Gi...
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
White or black?
And what's that?
Does it now?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
What else could it be?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
For certain, no.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Improved...how?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
No --- how does it go?
What happened?
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
But suppose he loses?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
I think they got me.
DAPHNE?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What happened?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
How can we?  We're broke.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
What message?  What motorboat?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
WHAT?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Oh.
Hey - these are real diamonds.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Not that, you idiot.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
We'll take a rain check.
And that's one of them.
Anything wrong?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And you've got cold feet.
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Josephine -
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
No!
Did he get fresh?
I always did.
Brand new.
I was it.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
You must be quite a girl.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
We can have it altered.
Why not?
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Because I got some plans -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
We got time off for good behavior.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Running away?  From what?
We understand.
Put it here.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
You can't trust those guys.
You know - I play tenor sax.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Which one is yours - the big one?
I'm not interested at all.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Guess!
Been waiting long?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Champagne?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Look at all that silverware.
What's on Thursdays?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Good night.
Really?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You're not?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
What's the matter, Sugar?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Thanks, Charlie.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I don’t think I can go through with this.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Does Kat know?
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
What’s going on with you two?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Hey, Kat.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
Brilliant.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Yes.
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Subtle?
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didn’t have to do that.
I always wondered what happened with us.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
And you say all them people is dead now?
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Can you swim?
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
You got two shirts on?
'Bye, Mama...
Poor creature...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
What's that you carryin'?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
There, you see?
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Is it Cartman's mom?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
CARTMAN!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Mom...
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Kyle?!
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Guess.
That's gonna take a long time!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Be careful, dude.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Shiteater-
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
And Bill?
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
You'd fuck your uncle!
What's going on Terrance?
Who's my cream puff?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
NAZIS!!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
What is it?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
Excuse me?
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
It's time we lock coordinates.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
Taylor?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I'm looking for a man.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Heh, heh, heh.
Three whips. To go.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Think he bought it?
100 years! 
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Son?
Hello?
Don't tell me, John.
How's that?
Uh...over easy.
It depends.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Where's Junior?
After we eat, Dad.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
132, 154.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Like this?
What's your specialty?
What does he do?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
He's dead Sheila.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Wait a minute --
Hold on --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Norman!
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Nobody move.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Thirty yards.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What is it, Norman?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
A half a mile long?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
What's wrong?
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
How can he be missing?
They switched us over.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
What is that?
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
You're next, Norman.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Norman.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
The refridgerator.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
He translated it wrong.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
A synthetic opium analogue.
It's like a sleeping pill?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Get away from me!
Would it work?
Then what is it?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
No.  I didn't say that.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Norman?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What is it?
We're never gonna make it.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Do you?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
What report?
What report?
You want me to try?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Are you all right?
What do I do?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
What about the princess?
Of course, where you been kid?
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
See Threepio... do you copy?
You rich kids... are all the same !
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
WHERE IS IT ?
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
So ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
Eeuch !
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You're late.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
...I'm sorry.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Where'd it come from ?
Diz, see what you can do.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
What is your position ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Then you acted properly, of course.
You saved the ship.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Was he difficult?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Time to impact...?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
We're losing the pattern...!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
They had a pattern to follow...
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You bringing your new friend?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
I have one, but they lost it.
You haven't heard of it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Yes.
How's your star?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
What is it all about?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Mornin', Doc...
What courthouse?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Isn't he...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
No, you're absolutely r...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
You guys had better leave us a...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Claire, when did you...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
-- she's got 'religion.'
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
Arrest him.
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Hi.
I...
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Who's White...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
We're out of money.
I can't.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
No, what is it?
<u>Siddown</u>!
How do they know that, you told them?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
What's in all the bags?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I've got two days to get this house...
I want them thrown in jail.
...not at all...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...the damn thing...
You think so?
Where are we?
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
How would you know sh...
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
And don't tell her I told you.
I could help with the debate.
Actually.  I could only help him.
This'll work, huh?
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
What if he's kidnapped?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Help me here...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
But you told us to starve.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
I'm fine, ba...
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
It's not good enough.
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Me too.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
We...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Machines do not EAT message.
...in.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Look, you've never liked me...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Ben never mentioned it.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Not yet.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
They're my kids.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Where you goin'?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Hey.
There are some rumors...
You know...Stanley...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Who is Jesus?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
What's an audience going to tell you?
Don't even joke about that!
We used pull.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
I can read it to you.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
What do you want?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
What DO you know?
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Whaddya wanna talk about?
OK.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Come here, give me a hug!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.
I hate reading.
I dunno...
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I do.
How many?
Great. How old are they?
You know...I like you.
You want some?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Whoopee.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What are we going to do!
Forget about it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well Filmore--
How well do you know this place?
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Go fuck yourself...
What about Cooper--where is he?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Agreed--let's move it.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Can I have a glass of water?
Possibly some coffee?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
I have your word, Mister President?
Where is this...thing?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Yes!
Go back to sleep, baby.
Does the threat board show anything?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
You aren't sure!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
Where, sir?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
What else could it be?
War.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
They must have made a visual contact.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
What does it look like?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
That's what I said.
Can't "Ace" help you?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
I said that's the point!
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Forget it.
We are?
Um-hm.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
That was really great.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
Yup.
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Good.
I know, man.
What?
Tim...
Bullshit.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Yeah.
Really?
Come on man.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Am I fucking him?
Hey! Hey.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
No, but I heard it was great.
Yeah, we're all above that.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You okay, man? You okay?
What's up guys?
Will you stand up for me?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
A Porsche.
Deep down. Way down.
That's what I mean.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Mm.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
Uh-huh.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Oh, yeah?
How?
What feelings?
Come with me.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
Mm-hm.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
To his hotel?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
Good, man.
Sorry.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Get off my property!
Look Pakeesa...
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
Pony, oh my god!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah?
Like?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
No, I'm going.
Soon.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Could you give me a ride?
Fuck.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
What?!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Hi, Jack.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Oh... What are you working on?
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Madonna.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah, hold on.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Ammo?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
Hello?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
All of you!
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
What the hell do you want?
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Name dropper.
You forgot this.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Check.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
It's just impossible.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Hello, Betty.
Hers.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Gordon Cole?
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
We've missed you too, dear.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What scene?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Have one of mine.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
He must be quite a guy.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
What's the matter, Max?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Paramount studios.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Home?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
We can't do that.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
Is this how?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
But what if---it wasn't real?
What is it?
I know it.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Why didn't you tell me?
Superman will return it.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
How'd you do that?
Your hair looks the same.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You're wasting your breath.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
What is this place?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Others?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Yes, mustn't stop.
What are you talkin' about?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You look wonderful.
You're welcome...??
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I can never get a way from it.
Well, aren't you excited?
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Do you really know Superman?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Wipe 'em out?
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Uh...what channel were you watching?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
You want to mess with Superman?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Thanks.  Let's go
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
The picture looks blurry.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
How would you know?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Oh, Superman!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
85,000 dollars.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
It could make weather!
She's not his mama either.
Small potatoes.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Yes! This time we got it right!
Jimmy, how's the -
Are you okay?
Actually, yes.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Does Lois know about this yet?
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Artemis? Do you read me?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Why?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
He has powers as we do . . .
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this . . . Superman?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
They make my eyes itch.
I've never been in a place like this before.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Impossible? Why?
Well, I don't understand.
I think he's kind of cute.
I think there's an angle.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
What was that about?
He's . . . cold. . .
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Destroy Superman!
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll deal with you later.
I know, but  --
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
Know what?
Big night coming up?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It wasn't a trick!
Super...man. Hmmm...
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
This??
So I've noticed.
What's the temperature now?
You're happy, aren't you?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
I don't understand.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
How old are you?
I...uh...
Is that real enough for you?
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes.
Ally Jones.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Then...when did she get better?
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
What happened?
Alison.
I hope she gets better.
I don't know.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
Have you been waiting long?
What time's he coming home?
I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
You hate it.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
And winter?
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Nicole!
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
That's right.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
Dolores.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Have they ever been busted?
How old is she?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
DADDY!!!
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you have the blood test?
Oh God, I'm scared.
Some more wine?
Yes.
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Are you a reporter?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
I was scared.
Why not?
You're going to blow everyone away.
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Yes.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Match me, Sidney...
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Uh huh.
I know Steve.  No.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
I thought he would.
I don't think so.
And where was his wife?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
But...
Who else phoned?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You ought to be used to me by now.
If that's for me, tear it up!
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Why me...?
You're talking very fast.
Did you now?  On which bounce?
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I can't
Please... let... the kids... go...
What does that mean?
Can I stop by my house?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Affirmative.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Will it melt in there?
We're better off by ourselves.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
Kyle, don't go!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
Can it be destroyed?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
What the hell are they doing?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
You bet.
What?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
How?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
I've remembered something else...
One of your people told me.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
You were in insurance before the war.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Do you understand?
And you're from the future too?
Just let me go.
Reese...you got a first name?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
You'll learn.
Bag some Z's?
That's where we're going.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
He'll find us, won't he?
I don't think I like this.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
And who was the enemy?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Why were the other two women killed?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Send a unit.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
What?
Pardon me... Miss... ?
This can't be real...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Don't even think about it.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll wait.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Nice.
A fresh shirt...
Where'd you get this?
Okay.
They're watching.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Nicholas...
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to get to the airport...
I redecorated.  What about you?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Tell me where we're going.
Who?
How do you know?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
What?
Split it?
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Guess!
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
What makes you ask?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
What?
What gentleman, Maria?
What the fuck... ?!
Attractive...
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
And what kind of sleeper?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
And those are Luke's and mine.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
You used the wrong test.
I, I just can't...
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
This is where we're going?
When do we take the tests?
Is there something about the house?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
Is it over?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Not for you, clearly.
As soon as you get dressed.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
I like the colors.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
What's the matter?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
We think someone is here.
Hey.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
What.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Edward Rama?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Huh?
Steady on.
Do you have any friends, man?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
Modelling.
When did you get in?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Right.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
How far?
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Which kind?
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
There is?
You do?
I don't get it.
What's in it?
What kind of trouble are you in?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Is he here?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Thanks.  You, too.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
...You don't like the music out there?
...I stank, didn't I?
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Ah yes, a music lover.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Sure.
No problem!
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
Where you going?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
OK, how did you know?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...So, uh, who should I--
...Huh?
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
'Lo, Ed.
...I'm Crane.
Doesn't bother me.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
Ippolito!  Get back here!
The body?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
It's still back there!
What's that?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
What's going on?
Dr. Frock?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
This room sucks.
Quiet!
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Oh... my... God!
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How did you know that?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't understand.
What happened?
They're all heavily armed.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
Is there another way around?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
The creator of what?
The memory of who?
How can they have a child?
You take Japanese.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What exactly?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Where have you been?
It'd be an adventure.
What did you want?
Let's go now.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Do they know?
Who?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
Who sent you?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men?
How can I reach you?
-- You saw this experiment?
No. I haven't.
Mulder...?
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Scully...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
I wake you?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
You said you weren't coming?
He didn't mention a park.
This looks like new grass to you?
What are my choices?
Yeah, well they may this one.
Been where?
This is weird, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
What? What's wrong?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Cold...
We're going to the morgue.
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
What is it?
A virus?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Nothing.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
...a pocketful of rye.
Agent Novak?
You think you can do this, don't you?
They're hungry.
What now?
Agent Cole.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
How is she?
Den leuten.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Oh, that was many years ago.
Seemed like a good idea.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I'm going back home.
Are you going, too?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Nichts danke. Kein.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Do you know this man?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Where?
What is it?
You a friend of Lime's?
See much of him before that?
Him dying like that.
...to him.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Get the next plane.
Well?
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Fifty yards right down there.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
A girl of spirit.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Do you know his number?
...his number.
They wouldn't know me.
Come upstairs a moment.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You told them, didn't you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Speak English?
Baron Kurtz.
...Popescu...
Could he have been conscious?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
The Roumanian?
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Yes, it is.
Something wrong.
Should I make it all fact?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
I'll share something with you.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Bonjour.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Everyone ok?
He tried to borrow money from us.
Have you told someone?
They only kill them when they love them?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Oh, please...
What do you care?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too difficult?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Which is what?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
When can I see you?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
What's it about?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Who's Eichmann?
An investment banking house.
You wouldn't announce it?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
And? WHat did you notice?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Give me a reason not to.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
What part of Germany are you people from?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Get out of here....
This will be a different kind of device.
Mrs. Moebius.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You missed on purpose.
You can't say that....
Who's this?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
Are you going to keep it?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Did the driver really freeze?
What's happened??
No!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
He seems to have won it.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
You forgot the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
And just where are you from?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Is it a poem?
He can learn.  He is learning.
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
What about the shoes?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
That's good.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Your mother?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Why?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
You don't have that one, do you?
You were right.
A drink to warm up?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
I recognize you.
Please, have a seat.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
You look adorable.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
Hello?
You'll try again tomorrow?
You've got to tell me what happened?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
How was your trip?
It's his heartbeat.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Wait!  Professor...?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
So why the long face?
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
Want to get a drink?
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Anything else?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Sure!
I want him to lock me up.
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
See you tomorrow —-
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
What, senorita?
Love is different for different people.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's about the leopard.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
It was you, Galbraith!
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Wait ——
What are you getting at?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
That's easy. Me.
Get it out of here!
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
I can use them.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Can it be that easy?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
Who is Friedman?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
Is there anything to understand?
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
To get me killed...?
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Crow what?
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
We’ve still got the Italian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
I’m calling about the puppies.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where are the kids?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
May I...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Where is Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
What is?
What is it?
Your lady friend did.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
It’s wet. Will this do?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Five seconds. Then you die.
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I thought you were an archer?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
I'll go.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
To be killed in battle?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Do as I say!
But that was her order!
Go onto the next question.
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Arrest them!
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Who are you?
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
How old are you?
What were you doing when the voice came?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Thanks be to God.
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Your majesty, I really think you...
Is it long and hanging down?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
You don't believe me anymore?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who... who are you...?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
What are you doing out here?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Are you going to leave me too?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Oh yes... very.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Beautiful.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Hello.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
When's your baby due?
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Can you help?
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What are you reading?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Dirty pig!
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Are the Russians here?
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
You don't want to learn.
You have to wash them.
What did she say?
We can't leave the piano
Play a gig.
Mama.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I thought you blew all your money.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
How'd ya do?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
You beat him, kid.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
How ya doin'?
She coulda killed me last night.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
What does this guy want?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Hooker!
You're dreamin', kid.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
What happened to your face?
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
She's got me worrying, too.
How are you?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
What is it? Has he found him?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
No.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Another Martini --
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
What about the suicide?
You've been there?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Get anything?
Could this be him?
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
Where were you?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I don't like him.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I can't! I haven't got it!
I'm not telling anyone.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Why tell me?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
Who's that?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Where did you get that?
What are you going to do with it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Good. I want to talk to you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
But it's Christmas now.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
He's just been for a walk.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
What do you mean?
How long has he been dead?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
I'm going to tell her.
Who do you think did it?
Is that true?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Bonds, sir?
I'm sorry...  but...
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Ready?
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
What about it?
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
Wes--
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
You think?
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Invest it.
They'll shoot us!
Steady it out!
She okay?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
There's a way.
I don't hear any--
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
They're doing more than slapping.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
If they land--
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What the hell took so long.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
What do you think our chances are?
I pick that way.
What do you figure it is?
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Well?
And then shoot them.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Is that good, or bad?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Can you ride a horse?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Australia.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
At-at-at-at-at.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Epps...
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
Maybe we should give him some water.
You're going to burn up in those.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Stress category.
Control ON.
Now?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
They're watching us now.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
Good Lord!
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Why did you have LUH come here?
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
That's not it.
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
Just look at all those people.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
They're not here.
What was-? Why...?
What?
Now wait just a fucking-
Treat. We treat devices.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
How long are we going to stay?
Ex-girlfriend?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Something round, two wires ...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
What do ay say?
Alright!
Why are we stopping here?
I want to work this.
Prints?
Vice... Jesus.
What was it this time?
Make an appointment.
A what?
So what're we looking for?
Nice to be here.
What's this?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
But--
You're looking fine, Major.
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
And as for you, waiter--
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
Thank you, Baron.
Monescu!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
Yes...?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Madame.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
No--yours, madame.
Like that!
Any minute I want!
Thirty-three--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Adolph J. Giron.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
You're certain?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
What?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
Something serious has happened.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
The boats are all going.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
Hello again.
So, you got a name by the way?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
It is that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And...?
May I cut in, miss?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
This is horseshit.
I'm not going without you.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Never let go.
Yes sir.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Don't come any closer.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Did you find it?
What did you want a gun for?
Aces full.
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Where have you been hiding?
Yes?
When?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
A little.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
What, again?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Who with?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Inspector McKinney.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Thank you, sir. 
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Come in! 
Three Jacks.
It's your deal.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Hello, young fellow!
Don't get yourself all worked up--
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Oh, there you are--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Am I a member of this club?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I don't get the humor of that remark.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
I went for four.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Yes, Yes!
Congratulations.
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
I'll explain later--
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Oh, my God...
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Where'd you get that horse?
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very instructive
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You really look awful.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
And I don't even know your full name.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I have to go.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
What about all these saloons?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
It's too late -
How did you get this number?
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
It must do something.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
... Kids?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
If I were you -
... Do you have a gun?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Not a lot of difference.
And when might that be?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sakwa!
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
How sweet.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Oh, no.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
I pay my own way.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
Since this morning.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Good afternoon, ladies.
How many people do you all feed?
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Right here in the van.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Right?  Buddy?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Shhhhhhh!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hey!!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
There.
This is ludicrous.
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Woody!  Speed up!
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Is there anything else I should know about him?
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
How long has -
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Did you do this?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Did you get it?
I think she's lying.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
My Leica's gone.
Is this bad for him?
How's David?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What if every country legalized at the same time?
In school?
Private?
What's that mean?
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think she wants?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Yes.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You first.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
You should feel good about this.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Hello.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
What?
I'm sorry.
OK. Same again?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
What's your name?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Diane.
What do you want?
Well, it isn't.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So, what's he like?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Exactly.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Who wrote it?
The park?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
God, you're sick.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Great.
Sure.
Sounds great, Swanney.
There.
It's fresh air.
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
With a starship!
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
But the shuttle-
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
What are you doing?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Be one with the horse.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
I am here, Captain.
I believe I have found a faster way.
It would appear we are too heavy.
What is this?
Spock?
I must have your starship.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
You are mad!
What makes you think I won't turn us around?



Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I know you better than that.
I don't understand...
You did break in.
Are you embezzling?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Did he say why?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
What for?
Of what?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Flynn?
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Flynn... you can't... I
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
A User?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Son of a bitch!
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Copy that.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
She's still at my house.						*
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
He's got it.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Hello, Harry.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Why did you continue to see him?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What were you doing there?
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
No.  But I wanted to.
What is it?
Do you still love me?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Boris and Doris?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
That was you?!
And you chased one?
To our assignment.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You got that playing basketball?
The forager's back.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
The letter I sent.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Tell me about yourself.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Do you get paid a lot?
What's that?
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Is he nice?
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
It's great to hear from you.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You're really in love, aren't you?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
Is he big league?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Do you really mean it?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Leave the gorillas.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Don't you?
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Why does he trust you?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
On their honeymoon.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Nicholson and I.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
He saw the wire.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Put it in your pants.
No.
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
No, sir!
Women will want to get to know you...
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
We're very close!  Because of you!
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
What kind of information?
A jail?  Prison?
July.
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
You smell so good.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
The gun! ... I lost it
Why are we doing this?
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Jo...Jose????
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
He was fully sedated!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Nothing.
It's a Movado.
Can I help you, sir?
Hey!
How much time?
How much!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
Yes, I have.
Thank you, John.
Where you coming from?
You've been around.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
A medicine man?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You never did answer my question.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You love him?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Have you ever been there before?
Jake.
John, please--
Shit!
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Grace . . . Grace?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
You got a suitcase?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Well, nothing.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Are you all right?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Who the hell are you?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Hungry?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I'm not rambling.
That's a bit much.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
The time wasn't right.
You love her, but you hate her?
It's not like that.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
I asked you a question.
I want to stay.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
I didn't do anything.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
What the fuck do you want?
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
Hey!
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would you?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
What happened to your hand?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
But he's dead.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Wasn't nothing.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Where you coming from?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You love him?
Did you ever?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I don't know about that?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Morning, officer.
I need a ticket.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Heineken?
Morning Grace.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Once again please?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Okay.
I remember you.
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What do you want?
Just give me a minute.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
How much is it?
I'm not scared.
Yeah, hello.
Was your family traveling with you?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I thought... you was an angel.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Yeah, I guess.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
What's all that wood?
I could run off them whores.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Duke.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
What?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Who killed him?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
He said that, huh?
Oh.
What for?
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Better re-load it.
Yeah, he's in there.
Yup.
Say, Bill...
Take a drink, Kid.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Three ways?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Who's he?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
K-k-kill somebody?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Fuck you.
His pistol must of jammed.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
There was ninety-one million -
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
They just said they wanted time.
Come home, Dean.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
He's alright.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
Get out.
You have to come.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
What-are they speaking?
What if I
Ready?
Let's say for example -
What about Redfoot?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
We're on vacation.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
What do you mean I can't see him?
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
So this lawyer...
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
You're not safe on your own.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Mr. Abraham...
How good's your intelligence?
Yes.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
No further questions.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Just now...
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
They lied.
I do.  Yes.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I am on the staff of...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Are you done?
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I'll tell you later.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
... now who is that ...?
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Been a long time, huh...?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
How are you holding up?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
Yes.  Yes, I have.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
One hour.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
I want to buy you a drink.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Dr. Towler...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Interesting business.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Nothing.
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
You.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
About three years.
Will you have dinner with me?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Come here.
Can't you see?
Why?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
I made it.
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Wandering about.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
How old?
Do you hear anything?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
Have you been here before?
Why did you jump?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What do you remember?
Where?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Yes --
Tell me.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Well?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Pop Leibel.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Mm. Better.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What I've been doing?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Well...
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
What's that?
I have plenty of friends.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Wait!
What are you doing?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
I'm calling the police.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
What?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
Money?
What are you talking about?
Who?
Yup.
She's in there!
I got her arm.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Easy Boyd.
Boyd...What have we done?
I said, what have we done?
I just want to get married.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Stop it!
May we have the rings please?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
The wedding cake check?
How do you figure?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Charles Moore for instants.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Well you should.
Where are you?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
No way.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Who's dead?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
What?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
No...No.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Greenpeace.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
You alright?
Pup corn?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
"You Send Me."
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Good times.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Take me there.
You have no feelings toward ...
What do you mean?
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Ramona! Ramona!
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
What are you doing here? Get out.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
It's for people!
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Are your parents alive?
Don't say that.
There's been an accident.
It's a very big one.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Have I slept long?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
What did you find out?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
How does he know who I am?
You need a maid.
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
SID —— NO!!!
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
You ready for this?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Don't worry about it, all right?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
What's the problem?
Which way?
How did you find out about the toxin?
Find out anything?
That's why I'm asking.
You okay?
More or less.
My guess is dead.
Where the hell are you going?
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
What crisis?
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
What is it?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...they sound what?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
We'll be back tonight.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?

Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Whaddaya think?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
Dartmouth
China.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
"The Country Is At War." 
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
W...what?
"Back End" ... count on it.
The War ain't over. 
Yeah...?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
What?
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.

Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
... That's what you told us to say.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your words, not mine...
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
You sure?
So, where are we going?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
How do you know?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello Bud.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
...isn't it perfect!
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
He still likes you
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah 
But?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Would you like a closer look?
No Jonathan.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Anyone else not coming?
Well?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Because he was worried about me.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Fireball?
What's happening to me?
I'm sorry?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
When...when will she be back?
Tell me.  Please.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
No.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Why are you here?
Wow.
I didn't sleep with him.
We were suite mates.
How you holding up?
You are?
Jody--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Someone's there.
Sit down here.
I have to go.
Something was there.  You saw it.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
I just wish you could have heard her.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I think so.  Maybe.
Yep.
You didn't?
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
When?
When you do this, I swear...
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
I don't need a shrink.
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
It's Madison Fra--
Ow!
Your wife...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
What?
Look for antiques...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I know.
I don't believe you.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
With his hands!
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Parents say he - uh - fell -
To love, you must be able to feel.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
What is wrong...?
I do not understand...
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
I'm serious.  You don't -
Rowan...?
You know...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
You alright...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Something's wrong with you.
Hi.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
On which planet...?
You okay...?
Rowan Mayfair.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Sounds good - thank you
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
Do you take sugar?
Sugar?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
then why did you marry her -
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
We've got nothing to talk about
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I want you out now
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Her husband left her
See? Did you see that?
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
You'll never believe who's in there.
I thought I loved her.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Well?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Sweetheart, what is it?
You're way ahead of me again?
You guys are my parents.
Whatever helps you cope.
You do know how to drive?
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
The one with the horses.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy? I was thinking.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Are they okay?
You're a peach.
He was my Grandfather, too.
That's a crappy thing to say.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Great.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Wow...you clean up nice.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
What about you?
Come on.
I want you to trust me.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
You called the cops on us?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Bad news.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
My parents? What do you mean?
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
You mean he withdrew...
Try, Kelly.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Maybe she used another name.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
That bothers you?
About a year ago.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I want a full-scale investigation.
Are you crazy, Ray?
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
The teeth, were they...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
No.
Get away from me.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
But I..
What?
What's wrong?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha!
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
You feeling all right?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Thank you.
Know what this is?
What's this?
Not again.
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
My hat is off to you, sir.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Your private train, sir.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
French?
Good work.  Really.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
When are they coming?
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You're chasing a dream.
Thank you, friend.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
I can't.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Then you get us out of here.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Fresh goat's milk.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
You!!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I'll help you...!
Did she ask about me?
Kill him!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Madmartigan.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Talk!  Say something!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Obviously.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Your hole is healed, then?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
What are you going to do?
Amish.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Now what's the problem?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But why?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Your husband's?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Buttons are Hochmut.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
That's God's way!
Anybody know about this?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
You hear me?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I will be the judge of that.
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He'll live.
Get back in there.
Momma... are they angry with us.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
To see?
...resourceful!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Ahh!  Ah!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Oh, now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh --
Oh --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Oh --
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh - I'll get it!
And him a brain.
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...free!
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
He said his mouth.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Yes -- there --
Oh --
Oh -- Oh --
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
...ting the ruby slippers?
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
Quiet!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Come on -- come on --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well --
How can I ever thank you enough?
What the hell are you talking about?
What is it?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Zukovsky...
It’s just a scratch.
Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
I can’t stay.
I don’t want to be safe!
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What are you talking about?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Was this all about the oil?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Now...where were we?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
The parcel’s in the post.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
A whore fucking.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I¹m not.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Old?
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
What the hell -- ?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
What caused it?
I can fix it.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
New information.
Who the hell are you?
What is this place?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
But programmable. And expendable.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
You do everything Yorgi says?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Aren't you afraid?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Did you do your homework?
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I can see that. Why?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Nice hops.
That's the guy.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
What are you talking about?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Are you all right?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
Let go.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The point of what?
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
I lost him.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Is that so?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Still happy you married me?
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
I suppose you're right.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
You mean... the laboratory??
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
I see.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
There wolf!  There castle!
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Throw the second switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
All right -- where is she?
I'm a failure.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
Hello there.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
It wasn't me.
Did you do it?
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Yes, I know.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
