Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
What crap?
No
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
But you hate Joey
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, no!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
So they tell me...
How many people go here?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
You get the girl.
What do you think?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
We're not.
No fear.
Who?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
That's what you want, isn't it?
What?
Do what?
You 're so --
Unwelcome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
How?
I hate peas.
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Because I like to torture you.
No, Daddy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Oh yeah.
We're your guys.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
With the teeth of your zipper?
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Tumescent!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
I know.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
This time with me!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
You did the same to your God!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
So was Christ!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
What did they say about Granada before today?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
Come over here.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
What about Oleg?
No.  No way.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
When?
Stay with her.
What are you saying?
Describe him.
Pretty.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
What's your accomplishment.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Hey.
I'm not.
Well, that's great.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Not what.  Who.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
You'll be my first.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes sir.
Don't speak Russian!
We have no money.  Come on.
Don't want to film this?
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
You want the tape?  There it is!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Oh yeah, why?
Clean?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
How long they been livin' here?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Okay, come on down.
Yes.
No. I never did, either.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
What is it, Hal?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
That's true.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I want to pick up my car.
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
What are you talkin' about?
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
There's nothin' to talk about.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Yeah.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Shit.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
What?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
When? How?
You're hopeless.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Jack, are you okay?
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Where is he?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Can't complain.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Give it back.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
I know...
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I'm saying.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Who?
Don't exist bud.
Leeloo..
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
I don't think this is a good time...
He's on vacation.
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
...Hoppi-hoppa.
OK, you can turn around!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Because...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
To fame.. salud..
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I understand.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
What you see is what I got, mister.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Is it?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Right here.
What are you... ?
Look, I don't know what this...
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I know what you did.
Fuck you!
I told you, I don't know.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Where?  Show me where.
Easy enough for you.
That's right.
They're no friends of mine.
Shut up.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Three, four years.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
Twenty-five.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
It's their Presidential Suite.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
I try to be.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
You've found missing persons before.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I don't understand, who are... ?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
I don't know.  I think so.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Who is this... ?
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
None too discreet, is he?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
I can't find him.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Then what else can we do?
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
She knew she was gonna die.
About Freddy?
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
Been having bad dreams.
She doesn't want me around
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
You're right.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Sobering...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Mark!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Then we'll find another way.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
I can't listen to this.
He invited me to his house last night.
So they caught up with you, too?
I guess.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
We'll have to look for them later.
Seems to be all around...
The frogmen?
Something wrong?
What????
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Take a look.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Obviously.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I hear Twombley got shot.
That was me.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
You think so.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Yeah.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Where's the plow?
I'm not saying that.
You mean Twombley?
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
But not now.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
How?
Wade.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
How's that?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Crawl!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
How was she?
What happened?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Wade, are you alright?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sorry, honey.
Some kids were teasing you?
Jim... for godsake!
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Stay cool.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
To swear you in as President.
About goddamn time.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Where are we now?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Rose, I don't have time for this.
What?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Please... don't start with me.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
White House Situation room.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
This is the President.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
Sir...
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
That just doesn't make any sense.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Don't be too long.
Roger.
Negative.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Scraps.
Sure.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
What should I say?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yes.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I can't tell.
That's right.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A hospital? What is it?
Well...
I just don't want to go over it any more.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
I love you, Elaine.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Who wants to be first?
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I'm Randy.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Lay off, asshole.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
I am George.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
And that fits?
And still it fits?
Did you talk to him?
But I-- .
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
My wife?  She worries about me.
You must leave me alone on this.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Do what?!  George-- ?!
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
No... two.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
It is. 
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
How long until it blows?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
What?
See you soon.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Corporal Hicks!?
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
On my way.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
No.  Have you?
Fuck you.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
What about me?
Where is she?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I know, honey.  Me too.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Newt, wait!
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Good morning.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Why? People fart backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
What?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Stanzi!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Oh, Stanzi.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Oh, yes.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Hey!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
Ah-ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Really?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Enchanted, Madame.
Ah, love again.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
How is your financial situation?
That's not what I hear.
This is just a game, Papa.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Why not?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
What exactly are you working on?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
How could I not?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
The man. He's here.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
Come. Let's begin.
What time?
Please! Just one moment.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes.
What for?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But, Your Majesty -
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What is what?
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart -
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
What difference does that make?
Did we?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Of course.
Dr. Hirsch?
Yes, Doctor.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Tea would be nice.
Yes?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Call me Alex.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
A werewolf?
Very nice.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
I'm freezing.
Don't you remember?
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, but we're about to.
Oh, come on, tell us.
What time is it?
What are you going to see?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you see Jack?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
David.
I don't know.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Shall we?
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Wrong.
Yeah?
Pecos Bill.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I can't stand it.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You must believe me.
What about the zoo?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
We'll find him, not to worry.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Matt?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I haven't got it.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Why not?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
Now?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Tomorrow night?
Now don't you worry about it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Yes, thank you.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Why, I don't know.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Yes, sir.
What'll we do?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Yeah.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Mr. Williams . . .
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Yes, why?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I don't know.
Yes.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Then where were you?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
That was two hours ago.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Leave me alone, Bob.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
... Will Perry ...
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Tell me.
What's going on?
It was exciting.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Sure, cousin.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
I got us through the War all right.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
I'm thinking...
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Sadie was not a man!
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Where is Jesse James?
Ho-yah!
On account of we're robbing it.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Mm-hmm.
You're doing just fine.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Heard of him.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
If I could go back to farming --
Yeah, Jimmy?
They're making him a hero now.
Boys?
Shush.
Mmmm.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
What?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
But I like the presidential suite.
Last February?
I figured.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Right here in church?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Lyla Devereux.
I remember you.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
No.
Can you put men at all four?
Stop it. I'm...
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Yes, I am.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
How did you guess?
No, he doesn't.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
What exactly do you mean?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Like what?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
See you then.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Can you bring Mr...
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Hmmmm.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
What are I doing?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Thanks.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
And?
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Al.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
"Make" him?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Didn't you visit the campus?
We're not gonna let it.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Gimme the coordinates?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
'Have a look?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
...Worse?
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why would you do a thing like --
The Day Care?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
It's three years old, it --
But you said the other --
What?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Uh. Not exactly.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
I didn't plan this.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Where is he?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Kiss me.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
We know all that, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thanks.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Sure.
What?
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Of course, luv.
Not now, Austin.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Sure.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Is it one of ours?
What are you saying, son?
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
They're mutated sea bass.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Not me.
I don't want to.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
He's asleep.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Why?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
No need. I'll call again.
Three days.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
I have an appointment.
Rules are made to be broken.
Hmmm ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
To find out who killed my husband.
Thanks, Valentine ...
But -- why?
'Our revels now are ended.'
I'm already married ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
I'll never marry you.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
June, July ... August?
Why should they think that?
Did he say who?
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Have we been invited?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
What kept you?
Still a bit chilly ...
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Global warming?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
This way ...
Walk over to the window ...
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
When do the girls get to the party?
I want Debbie.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What is this person's story here?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
So does Debbie.
Fan out and look for them.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
I've tried to change her mind.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
C'mere.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Yes...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
What's going on?
Yes.
I'll take some.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
All right, who serves?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
C'mon. I insist.
So long, Father.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Still drawing a blank.
Take care.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Who?
You got it.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Just come down, John. Just --
Not likely.
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
This?
Roll the hose.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I know.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Jennifer.
You look great.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Got anything to drink in there?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Uh huh.
Hi.
Yes.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Then who --
Trychticholorate.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
-- Another backdraft.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
But he killed these guys.
What reason?
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah? Airtight?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Yeah.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Engine 115, right?
Coffee sucked.
I was ahead of my time.
Cute.
The great communicator.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
And old ladies?
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
Who?
"The Strawberries"?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
I forgive you.
How about 7 1/2?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
You've really got a problem.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
B-L-A-K it is.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Meaning?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Different.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Well do something about it.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
No costume.  No blackface.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I've never been given a fair shot.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
This is Cheeba.
Which one is your brother?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
What do you want me to say?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
He's just playing big brother.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
You sound like the media.
Same thing Giuliani said.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
He said that?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
What do you mean?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
I thought you got rid of...
...no, she didn't...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
No, before my time.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Say what, Manray?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
What is your uncle's name?
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And his baggage?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Your cousins go out with him.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
It is my only object.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes, papa.
Is he all right, papa?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
What do we do?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you mean, alone?
Shut up.  West's dead.
Okay.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
The creek bed --
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
So did we. Why didn't you come?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
You hated West more than any of us.
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
Put it down!
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Well?
Because I was standing next to him.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Who killed Pike?
What are you talking about?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
You knew Sergeant West?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Good cop/bad cop?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
The very same.
What point?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Got it.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What happened next?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Let's go talk to Bill...
You couldn't have known --
Nah.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Oh, you remember now --
So you took off your shirt?
He wanted more than that.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
We've been making progress, I see.
Wrong answer --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
Shut up!
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
It's too neat.
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Yes.
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Lucky girl.
Can I take your picture?
I never knew.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Beats me.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Did you do any of that?
So how does it happen?
Okay.
Really.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Yes.
It would kill you, huh?
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
Really.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Yes.
They met at Auburn.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Yes?
No I don't.
What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
No I haven't.
Uh... Yes.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I'm asking what you're here for.
Good. 
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
You're asking for my documents?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Well as it turns out I did.
I said I don't have any.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Why not?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Why?
You don't understand you either.
Get out
You don't have to say anything
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
What?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm sorry.
It's more like a date.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, ma'am.
You hurt it?
This gonna get you in trouble?
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
You liked what I brung ya?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
I do. God's truth. I do.
Can I put it in your mouth?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Let go...
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Come on, gal...
Well I don't...
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Uh-uh.
The... chain helps.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Huh?
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Ask the chef.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Not like that.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Rae don't do this now...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I do.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Got in a little accident.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
The Wolf?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
No.
Nick, we can't just --
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What'd she say?
What does Charlie mean?
Give us a break...
I don't, that's all.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Why weren't you at the platform?
I can see that.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You can trust me.
San is an honorable title.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
Yes...
We can't lose.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You could fake it.
You met her.
Who am I supposed to be?
No one's keeping him here.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
This by this...
Why?
He killed a police officer.
You're foreigners.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Look.
I'll pay you.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Then go get him.
Death.
Come here.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
You're androids.
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Garbage man?
She's not with you?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
I know all that.
My pleasure.
Ya.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Four years.
Sorry.
These aren't just...
Meaning?
Yes?
Do you recognize any of them?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Of course not.
It would be my child.
Ugh.
Me and my dad.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
If they are smart, they take naps.
What?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
What's a long time?
No, I don't.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Go ahead.
If she is, the machine works.
What one?
What desert?
A tortoise.  What's that?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
Come where?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
What is it?!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Take it. damn it!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Doing what?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
My Mom and Dad.
Sorry.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Okay.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Is this your house?
Sure.
Okay!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Do I look crazy?
And don't be so obvious!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Eve, I'm sorry.
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you had better!!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No, son. A pitcher.
Why?
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
And it's called...?
Russia.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Bye, Adam!
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Just look!!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
How do you do, ma'am.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Well, we're here to help!
Sorry, Mom!
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
You bet, hon!
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
The locks.
Then after that it's safe.
I'm not hungry.
What shall we call him?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Just open the door.
Well, I am the head of this household--
Amen.
Some time.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I think...it...works.
No.
He's from Alaska.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He didn't leave with them.
He left with Sophie.
Coward!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Give it back to him.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Yeah.
Jeffrey nothing.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Who's it, you mean.
No.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Those are my breasts.
Speak to me Fucker.
Go where?
Yes.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
It's good to see you, Dad.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Two.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yes.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Frank!!!
Dorothy Vallens?
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
Go find one.
Let's do him right here.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
BLAME...
We... met them last night.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Be careful.
Aye.
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
He got beat up by a girl.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
Italian.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
A-fuckin'-men!
Rule of thumb?
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Can she I.D. them?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
How do you figure?
Where's my cat?
Pee...Per...Man.
It was... It was...
Really want to know?
What?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
We promise.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You believe?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Open it!
What do you want me to say?
How long since your last confession, my son?
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
That sets it off.
Yeah, I heard that.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Look at the treads on those.
Bob?
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
As long as he gets out OK.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
We said 48 hours.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
If you say so.
Would of been nice.
What?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
That's not correct.
She needed it.
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What is it?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
As a person?
Roger.
Hang on a second.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Careful. Check his pulse.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Behind Bob's house.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Dignan, I --
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Sure.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
That never would of --
It's true, Dignan.
I'll just drive my car.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
There were more than that.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Watch me.
What's his name?
Anthony. Bad news.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah?
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's having a heart attack or something.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
What's that?
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Did you hear that?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
He's damn good.
Well, I think --
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
Sure.
Good to know you, John.
What?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No good options left?
No. You lost your way.
It was staged?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I speak English.
No, I do.
I don't know.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I worry when you get like this.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
What?
Where are you going?
You do?
Who is Pamela Landy?
What do you mean?
Bourne?
And the Germans can't match it?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
By who?
Are we hacking or asking?
It was in Latin, sir.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Wallace's followers.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
I rest.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
That depends on the man.
I will not.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
No. He did not.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Humbly, M'lord.
You are. And I'll come again.
You scare me.
And I with you. But you must wake.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
What is it?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
And the bad news?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
How long will I be in here?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Can you protect me?
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Yes.
No, protecting her.
I thought you were a December baby.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Damn. Your dad did this?
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Of course.
Like how?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Deal. Now read me something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Huh?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I'm sorry.
You're such a retard!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Suppose we do.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
And the other alternative?
No.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Looking for a job.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Yes.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
No.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And Laszlo?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Yes, ma'am.
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We'll discuss it later.
Apparently he has the letters.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
What for?
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I said, ask your wife.
Thank you.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Thank you.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Perhaps.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Victor Laszlo?
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Thanks. I will.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, thanks.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
I never make plans that far ahead.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Put that phone down!
Hello Ugarte.
For how long?
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Yes, boss.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Going to die anyway.
Take it.
Take it, damn it.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
I'm putting it off.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Okay.  Sure.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
I thought I did.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I thought you might have.
You have any children?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
You too.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Yeah.
Mom, meet Jango.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Don't you even think about it.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
I'm touched.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
We're on.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
I braided them.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
To Wilson.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Really?
Burma!
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Well, they aren't.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
You mean somebody asked?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I don't know it.
Nobody's named this one yet.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
That's it.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
What view?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Two million.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
It's not true.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
We're going to give him the money back?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I told you, use less powder.
Two million.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
You sure?
We'll use the Euc.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I can't do that.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
We're not cops.
I'll worry about Customs.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Uh-huh.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
We never had a problem with that before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I'm sorry.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
What?
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
In over your head?
A little bit of both.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
What do you want?
Jack Manfred.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
How about five hundred.
Seven-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'll try and make it.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Tension. It'll go.
I'll see you in my dreams.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Never. Why do you ask?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
I'll watch.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What about my neck?
What for?
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Have I?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Thanks.
Nice car.
I don't gamble.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Jack.
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
They've been tested.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
What for?
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
The key!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
-- open quantum latches --
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hey, bomb.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Mafhkin oble groop...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
What?
Commander Powell is dead.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Yeah?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
It didn't work?
Talk to the bomb.
Phenomenology...
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Where?
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
When?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Something.
Yeah...
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Yes on all counts.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
I don't know what to say.
Look, thank you for this but--
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Any idea when she'll be back?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're also a fool.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Bastard...
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I actually know how this works.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
I'll give it my best shot.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Theo's dead.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Yeah?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
One more time in English.
Check!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Damn straight we are.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Curly.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Sure.
The easy way.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
I said, I'm sorry!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Yeah.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
I am so sorry.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Until it withers away.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And you'd never been there before?
Who?
Maybe she's asleep.
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
It's safe here.
Why? Is this about the book?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Yes.
No. That makes you keep searching.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
I know.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
What else makes you feel regret?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Because you tell Mom everything.
What I think is going on with your son.
You're not a bitch.
Donnie? You're a dick.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Raspberry.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I stole four beers from my dad.
She's alive, sweetie.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Oh God, I'm dead...
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
My mom wanted me to have this?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I love you much.
Bitch!
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Uh, Gladys?
We need more bars!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
He should be king!
And everything.  He should be king!
Send for my car...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't want him.
What do I get?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
I can't do it right away.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Bah!! 
That's it...
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Now -- er --
Why -- why -- of course.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I thought everything was working out fine.
No, I think a whiskey.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
Indeed!
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes, I think I can.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
You've never been?
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Oh no, my friend...
Thank you... very much.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
John Merrick.
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Righteousness...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
I've heard.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Who, Father?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But, Father, it IS!
What are what?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
And the week before that?
Why?
Goodbye, Aud...
No... no...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
You're just saying that.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
You've got to let me go!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Don't talk nonsense.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I don't know! I just did!
But...
It saved my father!
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
I know. I know.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
She got me thinking...
Look out!
So?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Keitel Blacksmith?
But...
I will join my grandfather there.
I was sitting there.
Over the Edge of the World.
Bye... sorry...
Please.
The Dragon...
Do what?
He hasn't.
No, I'm not.
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
Can't make enough swords!
That's right.
Well... I... I thought...
Help!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
But it's a responsibility...
I must only let the red rage...
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Me too.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Yes, Mother.
I never do...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Yeah, I got it.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Well, anyway... Sorry.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I like to read.
What?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Oh, yeah.
You'll call me, right?
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I don't want to talk about this here.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
What was I wearing?
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I don't know.
I'm nervous, too.
I don't know.
Your dried cum.
Hi.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Long day thinking.
That's your look for me.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Well... I did.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Go back to sleep.
I hope you get your work done.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
I know. Anyway --
It's a good one all right.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Nothing.
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Is that Nietzsche?
It's no big deal.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
She likes you okay.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Save your breath for the climb.
I don't.
About...
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Well.... er...
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I'm the best.
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Bonanza Jellybean?
A job for me?
I heard it.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
Trauma.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
What happened?
Pressure?
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Starck!
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Justin.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Skipper...
...you okay?
Do it.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
I'm not the Devil.
NOOO!
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
We don't have time to fart.
That's enough!
What about the life readings you picked up?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
What's going on in there, Starck?
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
He's dead...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Do they have pressure?
I can't believe we built this.
Yes.
It wants me. I have to go.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I'm worried about you.
What is this? Where's Reed?
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Youthful high spirits.
Victor's better at these things.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
That's terrible news...
Ben, are you there?
I can go hotter!
They're not costumes.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
Excuse me?
Are you kidding?
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Not at all.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Just find him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Of course.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Okay, Dennis.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Mark is a really nice boy...
I know what I look like.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
He's my friend, too.
What? Are you all right?
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Yeah?
Really.
No Damone. I don't understand.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
All right.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Not since November.
No. But it's a nice idea.
No.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
What?
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
How about your phone number?
No problem.
Sure thing.
Not at all.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Really?
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
You whore!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
GO?
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Where'd you get this?
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
We can't risk letting them in.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
We're going to get my little girl.
With what just happened upstairs --
C'mon guys--
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
And the rest of 'em?
Just move!
Fuck you too.
No. You?
He's dead.
My truck.
Oh.
Okay then.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He shot you the other time.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Nothing.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Move slow and move quiet.
If he doesn't shut up...
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
HELLLPPP!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
YOU'LL HIT US!
And the last one is the...
Not without you!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Um, well...
I said I'm not lying.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Who's this?
Thank you --
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Frances.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
GET OUT!
...Yes.
What night?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
All square, Doc.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Thanks, Dad.
He's a socialist, then?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
They'll mend.
Not me. But other people seem to.
You think I'd miss it?
What happened to him?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Eight stories.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Forget it.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Huh?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
What's that?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Yeah. I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Well... you're looking well.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
What'd you do?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Yes, Ma.
You're taking me home!
Then why did you bring them?
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
What's wrong?
I have!
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
I see.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
No!
Better that way... for me.
How did you find me?
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Quite right!
It's been months. It's not like him.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
And you?
All my life I've known.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Your decision. For us.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
It is
I have been waiting for this ever since.
It wouldn't dare.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
No. He had more important work.
A... week?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
No, no, they're all dead...
You told her to sweep the courts.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I finished the boats.
You okay?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You're right. It makes no sense.
I'll go take a look.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I can't, Barry...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Dancer.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
I love you.
Lead the way!
There you are dead wrong.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Rocky Road.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
I got to.
That's thirty percent.
Another coincidence.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I said new, this is an '90.
The truth hurts.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
What's this about, money?
On the dresser.
Scott and Kate.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
In the Winnebago.
Yep.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
You asked me if I would --
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Me too.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Whatsamatter?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
One... Two... Three.
No.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Sight seein'.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
What?
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Or what?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you look like.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Entering my scan now...
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I'm sure it is.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Sir?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Just like you would be.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
And how do you know that?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
He was married?
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
Show us where you are, Chief.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
North?
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
The first female President?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
Nesting?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Speak of the devil.
Who is he?
Call me Charlie.
Well, I think you're cute.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
You're fast.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why do you need that?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Thanks.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Like YOU know?
You go first! There's no time!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Yes. Good was done this .....
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Alex? Where are you going?
Nobody was WATCHING?
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Excuse me guys.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes?
There is no weather in space.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Something BAD happened here.
All right. Put me back on with him.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
We're doing episode 31?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Tell them? About...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Why does this sound so familiar?
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
Because it was on the show!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Simpler.
But... Inside, I have seen-
Wh... Where are we?
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
I?  You all know my history.
Same old story.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, general?
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Lafayette will not be happy...
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
No one knows...
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
General Lee, sir!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
My God, what?
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Some things must never change.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
You know very well who it is that I love.
But not more than your comfort.
That's a lie!
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
It's the freest land on earth.
Well, we must be who we must be...
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
So you didn't have the key with you.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Harry, let me answer that.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
In the can. That the money?
What?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Leo, I don't know.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Who?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
I'm a producer.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
I know what a marker is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
You're kidding, right?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Twenty seven hundred.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
They report it to the IRS.
I'll find you, Leo...
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
That's right. Three percent.
How much is the wife offered?
There a part in it for you?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Oh.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Are you going down?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Be quiet and listen.
'We?'
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Hello, Martin.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
Thanks.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
What?
What?
Maureen?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Gimme a break.
Oh yeah.
A what?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Sorry.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Yeah. Thanks.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
You're more practical than superstitious.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Greer?
Same. Any luck?
But where's the damage?
Doesn't matter.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Victims of what?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
We hit land.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
What do you say, Dodge?
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Yeah.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
We could call for help.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Drink up then.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
A what?
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
How should I know?
What is it now?
I guess.
But I can't --
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Jesus...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Hey Josh.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?
You loser.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Forget it...
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
You loser!
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I'm going to tell him you said that.
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Totally! Look!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Bingo!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I don't believe you.
Where did you get that?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Go ahead...
God, you're really obsessed...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
It's kind of falling apart.
Yes.
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
Yeah, but still...
Are you okay?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
So, what happened?
What? You're kidding me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Really?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
And you like them?
Can you at least let me in?
Do you have anything to drink?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
They're Seymour's.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
I don't know... where is she, then?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
As are they all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
How; we don't know where they are?
How could it be? I hate Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Then we agree. 
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
That's very considerate.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Have you ever failed?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Since his beard was red.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Not even close.  What happened?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
I'd rather not.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Does he ever mention me?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Command me, lord.
-- the sorrow --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Do I?
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Like what?
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I'm Peter --
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Hi, Louis.
Are you sick, Louis?
I am Zuul.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
No?  What do I act like?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
I want you inside me.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Die in what sense?
Here are tonight's calls.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
A square?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
What?
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
Does she want to be?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
We'd better adjust our streams.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do I say?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
Where are you, Pete?
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
I don't think it's Shandor.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
And the seas would boil ...
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
You flatter me, Caesar.
I'm serious.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He left us at dawn.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Yes, Caesar.
You're hearing about somebody else.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Only from a distance.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Would that Marcus had lived.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
They fear me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
They're studying with Cynics.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
You teach them!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Don't be ridiculous.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
No.
I'd love some.
No, I couldn't.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
No.
Here? In Berkeley?
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Come in.
All right then! Yes!
Because it isn't true.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
My belt.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
I don't see how we can.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No, Benjamin.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Not exactly.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
I want you out of here.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Is what a girl?
That's right.
Right.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
No.
Yes.
I'm very neurotic.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What's wrong?
What?
Like what?
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
What if he did?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Yes.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Waiter!
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
I'll be up in five minutes.
The number.
You're welcome.
This is all terribly wrong.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute.
If you want.
Are you tired of it?
How about art.
Neither.
Yes I do.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
I walk out.
Thank you.
We don't.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Are you shocked?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I don't think we were the first.
What?
There's nothing to tell.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
Benjamin?
Yes.
Now don't start this.
Don't start acting hurt.
But if it's sickening for you --
May I stay then?
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Sir?
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
About an hour ago.
To be what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Benjamin Braddock.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
I'd like to discuss this.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
Well?
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
No --
What about the money?
How?
That.
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Of course.
All right. We'll dance.
Yes --
Yes -- oh!
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
How tired you are!
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Oh -- 
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Shall I see you again?
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Bless you --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
How's the beautiful lady?
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
No, Doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
You are ill.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Money!
What?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Later?
Moreover --
Moreover...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Can't you understand me?
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
I understand perfectly.
Why not?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
We did not approach you.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Oh -- but it can't be.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Good morning, Gru -- your --
I could not think of not accepting.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
My son was in the hospital --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
What's that, Lilly?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
So here we are!
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
What? He's going to be all right!
I'll get you a check.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
They twisted my arm.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
And Myra's stuff?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Not very good!
Never.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
What?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
This time...
Scram. Go home.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
Oh, don't be stupid.
Every day in every way.
I'll sign that affidavit.
I'm a salesman.
The long end. Big con.
And when he got serious?
Yeah? How?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Sure.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
I went out to Delmar.
What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Gun?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
It's Amy Kramer.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit.
And miss the big game?  No way.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Will, sit down...
Get on the bus.
Why not?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
He's my brother.
Yeah.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Where's Shane?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
The voice man!  He's here!
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
He's gone.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
I'll meet you over there.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Jamie's baby ...
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Stay away, Sam.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
No!!!
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
You know me, boy.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Sorry.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I dunno.
What's this?
Everybody thinks that.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I've considered that.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Where's Mom?
England?
I don't know.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Can't it keep till morning?
Damn.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Give us time.
We thought it was an emergency.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Ram it up your ass!
What a honeymoon.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
If he wants to go.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Sounds quite beautiful.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
No.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
Out!
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Are you've seen it work cures?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
What for?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
We'll find out now, won't we?
Comical?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Jesus.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
What will you do, Colonel?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
I'll kill myself.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
I was afraid to ask.
I didn't know that.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Who have you been talking to?
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
He can hardly talk.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
You're taking Mom out tonight?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He is my father.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
He's not your son.
We met here earlier this evening.
Goodbye.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
You mean I'm black?
But is she, has...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Wait?
Yeah, yeah...
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
You're not a film producer, are you?
She's dead.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
'Sucking off.'
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
He deals in pain.
Fuck.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
You really believe all that?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
That's like a stag film.
What's it called?
Do you think she's safe?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Does she know anything about this?
Just leave me alone.
What?
What is going on?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Where!
Rucker.
Okay.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
What?
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Yes, I am.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Oh, I don't have one.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
None of that, lady.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Not very.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
It's very interesting.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What do you mean?
Because they are all the same.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
No more revolts.
But I don't play anything.
I don't know.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
It's so blue.
With Life.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
What is it, Harold?
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
I don't know. Perhaps.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
What?
I don't care what people say.
Can't complain.
Like a tea ceremony?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
A rough estimate.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To pit your own life against another.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Oh sure.
Yes.
Yes!
You a doctor, too?
What's the matter with her?
What are you talking...
Finish what?
Then why are you here?
And what about you?
Yeah.
You mean, outside... with her.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
See? I don't like that --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Who wards off demons.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Me?? C'mon --
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Grounded? Who's grounded?
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
You call that thing a cigar??
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Shh! Just a second.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
No. Myers is taking me.
A brute.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Hi.
Sure.
Who are you?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
Stay the fuck away from me.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
I don't want to see the dress.
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
Good.
Let me see.
What kind of doors?
So you were cheated.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
I hear you.
In here.
I'm here.
Can I get you anything?
Sure.
I've seen worse.
What's wrong with you?
Don't go upstairs.
That's right.
No.
I got through.
I found a room.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Call me tomorrow.
Is Julia here?
Never better. You sleep well.
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
What's the problem?
That's right. Cointreau.
I thought we'd lost you.
It's late.
We walk.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Your father told me you were working here.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Oh, so what's the point then?
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Ha.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
No way.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
They always seemed...
Why?
Oh, hi.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Pardon me?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
What do you mean, four more?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Can I help you?
I understand, Dick.
Yeah.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
I dunno.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Just the obvious stuff.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is what better?  Better than what?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I don't have your number.
It's me.
That bad, eh?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
To make you feel better.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
No, but...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
I'm alright.
Hi.  What are you doing?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Are you persuadable?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Everything all right?
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Sixty.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
This one came unassembled.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
It's in good condition.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Carl Smith.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You are being foolish.
Are you?
No one knows you're here?
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
They do it each year.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
What about that family in '31?
Is that a threat?
All of it finished.
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
You and I should talk first.
It'll never stick.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
What are you doing man?
Your name is Conor?
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Pheasant.
You're a long way from Inverness.
Yes.  Always.
Go to hell.
I feel hardly nothing.
That is not me.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Romirez is dust.
Not likely.
We have no understanding.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
I don't know.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Leave her out of this.
Are you here?
It doesn't.
I presume it's a sword.
A mystery.
Where were you Tuesday night?
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Same.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

Oh.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Get out of here, you!
Out of the mouths of babes.
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
You -- you --
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Thank you.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
We're not interested.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
I know. Where is he, I said.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
I know, but --
Huh!
What tickets?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Walter, you can't do that!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I'm busy, Duffy.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Three sixes. Is that any good?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What?
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Yeah. But I --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I was just going to!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Now, Hildy --
I'm telling you!
What did you do with her?
I thought so, too.
That's good.
Mother!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Very simple, Earl.
They're not human!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
Get the Governor on the phone!
No, I don't think so.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
She and Mollie were talking.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I know.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
I don't mind.
Yes.
Bugger off.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Would.
Ask her yourself.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
Well, for the baby, really.
The sodding water table.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
Air-raid?
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And absent bridegrooms!
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
The ideas you get in your head.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Grace!
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Baby! Stop!
Who's your Daddy!
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
You're welcome.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Fucking great.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Hey, wait take this.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I don't.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
How much further?
Well, technically I did what ya said.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
There's not enough room.
What?
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
That seems likely.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Help, help us.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Sleeping.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
She looks like she stinks.
I can't believe...
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
What do they call you, sweety?
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Huh?
Huh?
Enough with the stupid voices.
No, just a little too old.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Right.
Excuse me for a second.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Not in front of the boy.
Stop. Get away.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's okay, Puff.
I want to be the way I was before.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
You've got to respect that.
Paper or cloth?
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Nathan!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Of course.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
I have to think! I have to think!
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
I'm just preoccupied.
Sure. Of course.
I guess.
How come?
Thank you very much for that.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yes.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
It's open...  What'll you have?
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
That's right, Miss Packard.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Do we need words?
You know what's good for him?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
How?
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Good, good.
It's possible.
What is?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
What's that supposed to mean?
To do what?
Why?
For who?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
How good is he?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Aaaahhhh!
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I told you you'd get your money back.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Glad to meet you.
How much?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah. Sure.
Ten dollars.
Hi.
You're a pretty good player.
Yes.
What?
Since four.
Thanks. I will.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Around.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Haven't you opened it?
What's this supposed to mean?
Me. It's Eddie.
Why did he tell you?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
I love you.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
No.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Yes.
Yes.
What's inside?
Yes.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Stay alive.
Yes.
Virginia...?
That's fine.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Okay.
I'll take you to school.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Why, yes.  Why?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Hide the car.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
What?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Oh?
You have to leave the White House.
He's a good man.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Did it work?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Haven't you been watching?
Three years.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Can't this thing go any faster?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
He wasn't the President then.
What'd I say?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Then God help us.
She should be shortly.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
Then find them.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
It had been deemed classified.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
He's my angel.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
No. Exotic.
How to kiss ass.
Jimmy, stay with me.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
We're leaving.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Yes.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Where?
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Yes?
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
You said go between them!
The Grail Diary.
Don't know. Think of something.
So it did.
Where is it? I want it.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Junior!
I came to get you! What do you think?
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Umh?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
...the solution presents itself.
Brody's this way.
What final challenge?
What about Marcus?
I know, Dad!
It happens to me all the time.
Ready.
But, Indy --
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
My name is Kazim.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Why they glow like that?
Two are still missing.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Oh yeah?
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A SNAKE!!
First of all -- don't panic!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
What does the writing say?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Just try and control yourself.
Maybe he likes older women.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
No... the heart's still beating!
Yes?
Yes.
What is your name?
Where are we?
...I need to make a phone call.
Yeah?
Where are we now?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Loading a gun.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
You gotta help.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
With Authority!
What do you mean?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Don't know.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Why not?
You'll be me.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
What was?
You're out of shape.
Try another language.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
To the hotel. To register.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Well you did it today.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
This...is not going to work out.
It is my business. It's my name.
Why not?!
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
How do you know?
This just won't work.
What if she says something important?
Oh come on.
Is that all?
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
I told you, I have a feeling...
I can't see a thing.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
And Dieter?
I can't handle that thing.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Oh, I can't.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Who's our little man?
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
He work for us?
We insist.
How do I look?
Thanks.
I feel fine.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Yessir...very good sir.
Oh...I can't. Business.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
...Rene.
That you're not crazy.
You did.
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
Why'd you run off?
There's not much to tell.
Last night?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
This going to work?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
They asked about you.
You can say that again. What do we do?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
It was my choice.
Why did you, then?
Why not, what are you going to do?
If he was able, what would he say.
I told you, I work for him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Piece of mind.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
A drink...
Why not?
Tear it apart?
It'l be alright.
Poor bastard.
Hi, Daddy.
Okay.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
That remote control thing?
How long?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
I'll be there.
Yeah. Catch you later.
Good.
Before you go...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Hey, Lowell.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Call me back in ten.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
That's my stuff from the office...
No, thank you.
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Hello? Yeah...
They're killing the Wigand interview...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
I'll call you then.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What's this?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Everything interests me.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
You believe that?
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
I heard.
Yeah, great.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You called me.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Where you staying now?
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
That's why we hire scientists...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Howard!
You did good, Massey!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
What part?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
You want Botox?
Set one side for Bel Air.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
What?
Yes?
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Absolutely.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Your mother was.
Huh?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes. Again.
I know.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Hello Marylin.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
May I come in?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Marylin!
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Forgery? Fraud?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
You have some?
Sometimes I forget.
Jesus.
Please!
You used his credit card.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
She did a Harriman.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
I guess.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Video.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
"I found a million dollar baby—"
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
No.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
No, I'll go through with it.
Why? Do you know him? 
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Sock her!
What do they say?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Oh—the papers—
You win!
Yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You always want to run everything.
To New York?
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
What?
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
was—but—
Hitch-hiking.
Clever.
A black eye. 
Me?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Come here, you little fool!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Just your imagination.
Thanks.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Don't "Joe" me.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Collect?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
Hey, you!
What?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Huh?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
No, I'm not...
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Yeah.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Dave?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, you don't!
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
How many shots you say you heard?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Nonsense.  What next?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
What?
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Well... yeah.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
The Warren Commission call him?
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
His name?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
More than ten years.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
The assassination, Jack?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I know. That's why I went.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Course you didn't.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She wants to make a deal.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Fine.
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
In cash.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Why does it need to be dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
How many trips did you make?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Are you?
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
How was it?
I don't care.
They seem to like the idea.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
I didn't say you did.
Spain.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
I'm just tired in general.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Not every day?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
What the fuck is that shit?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
If I'm working, I can help you.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
A Broadway shopping bag.
You two meet?
You talk to him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
I never have. It's not my money.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
So what happens now?
Great...  ...Wanda!
Beaumont Livingston?
Keep it between us girls?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Do you got something for me?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
All your money's in Mexico.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Who?
So we need two people, two women.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Two months shy of four years.
Bank robbery.
Yeah.
We had done time together already.
You been to Japan?
You lived in Japan, when?
Who's arm is that?
Yeah.
You live with him.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
That's good money.
That was Beaumont.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Yep.
What does that mean?
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
What?
Tell me.
How am I supposed to know that?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Cops can't locate him, huh?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I got some more business for ya.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Did the police contact you?
What does she do for you?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
Have her bring the money here.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
I was gonna tell you...
Where do you want to go?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Della?
I could have told you that.
Maybe the demons are real.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Used you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Why do you say that?
He told me he was going to Hell.
How long had that been going on?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
You should go back to her.
What? By myself?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Carlson? Is he new here?
I don't want to know.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Who did?
No. Don't move me.
Where to?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
I don't know.
A good lay.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Why do you bring her up?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Where?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Lie down!
Am I home?
I love you, Jez.
Why didn't you call me?
I can do anything I want.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Sit down, Jake.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I'm tired.
Then don't bug me.
Don't be funny.
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
So why tell me now?
Push 'em back.
What?!
Total delirium.
Call my chiropractor.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Paul Gruneger!
What's wrong?
Who is?
You come home with me.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Pause play.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What?!
And you said high school was boring.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Two more charges to go.
We could convert fission transistors.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Negative.
I'm pulling, damnit!
I thought you meant...
Were you close to your father?
You?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
I know you.
I'm stuck!
Old woman?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Oh I like her a lot.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Small brains make your balls itch?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Kay-em 14.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Oh shit! There he is!
Am I in there?
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
We're missing two of the kids!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
What?!!
Nanotechnology.
Get him out of there!
What have I done?! Idiots.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
I know who he is...
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Do you see the kids?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Do I need any more authority?
Why?
I don't know if I can do that without a...
My kids were on that beach...
You could say that.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
They must've hit something.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
So would I. Come on in.
He's busy.
Transplants?
Let me see your hands...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
I'm okay...
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I don't think so.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
I don't know...
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Well, I do.
I totally heard you did.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Okay.
Yup.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Hon, did you get expelled?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
You weren't even alive!
You're kidding!
You know... it's parts...
You don't have to do that.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
What?
What's the matter?
Really? Fingernails?
Sure.
This is the baby. Your baby.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You're pregnant?
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
You mean like couples?
Tore up from the floor up?
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It was magnificent, man!
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
They're yellow.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Adele for god sake please lis...
...I said, I like your hair.
Karma.
Not really.
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
What's Early been in jail for?
...That's not true.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Walter Livesy.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
...Then some.
Yeah.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Thank god!
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Look again!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Where's Adele?
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
No, never. Excuse me.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Wasn't my fault...
Who are you?
Without his car?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think?
Yeah.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Who?
Bet.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Nothen' B.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
You were?
I like you too.
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
Yeah.
Because, you know why. You know.
Do you care about me?
What?
You're OK?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I know.
Passion...
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
It's very monotonous.
Yeah.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
I wouldn't know.
Sit down!
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
It's a voice modulator.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
I haven't got time for this.
Did you know her?
You're not going to tell me that.
Very good.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Thanks.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
I just can't believe it.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Nothing.
For what?
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No Frank.  No prints.
And this Jeremy--
Anything else?
Meaning?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
That's a big area to cover.
What does that mean?
We're going to work on the message.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
No.  I don't.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
Another kind of game?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You're not?
No.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
You don't understand.
Of course not.
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Colwyn.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All directions are the same here.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
Does the Queen live?
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
Reach out farther. Call to her.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Let us wish him peace.
The Beast will kill her.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
We must enter the swamp.
Saddles.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
What business?
He saved our lives.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
I have need of friends.
You will follow me.
To the place where Death lives.
Not sleepy, either?
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Would you desert your friends?
Look at its insides.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
How many did you lose?
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
The Widow of the Web?
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
That is true.
Ynyr!
Yeah... How do you know it?
No?
No.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
Huh... 500 meters?
What, for example?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Perfect.
OK.
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
I never rent my gear.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Nothing, for the moment.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? Why?
Messina.
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
No it's not.
What?
I won't let you die.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
That's enough.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Yes.
Then why?
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
Where?
Pacifica, California.
That's all right isn't it?
By car right?
Walking where?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
Don't do this.
It's mine to risk.
Where am I?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
It's yours.
Water.
Hello.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No -- S.E.R.A.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
You what?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
I know that...
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Yuri... are you...
I can't tell you.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Are we done for today?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
That's not what's important.
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I believe you! Don't worry.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
Because they got wet.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Thank you.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
How about --
Spill.
That's terrible!
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Definitely! I love him!
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Really?
What?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Margot!
Did she do that to you, too?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Oh, my God!!
Is he the only one?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
What happened?
What, like on va-kay?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
You should. Do you have a resume?
Maybe she found him like that.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Thank you. Having fun?
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Yeah, luckily.
Then we smash 'em?
Purely a precaution...
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
To finish last evening's delightful work.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
But I'm hideous!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
What do you want from me?
What will become of me then?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Oh no... Don't you understand?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Will you lead me to her?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Jack, don't!
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
It bodes evil.
We'll find it.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Can you save her?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
What weapon?
Never show mercy!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I'll try.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
I may have said perhaps...
Or perchance...
Unicorn?
Stop complaining.
I'm not its master.
Are you honest?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I don't want it on me.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
In the dark... where I join him...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Lili... I love you!
Pinching me!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
She's dead!
Sorry.
No fear of that now.
Only that?
And am I not fair?
And sweet?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Be fair, Oona.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Oh, but I have.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
That very nice.
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
What's wrong?
Who are all these people?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Monday.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
What did you think it would be?
Hi.
He jumped into the ocean.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I can use your mom's.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
What are you talking about?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Will he talk to me?
And if I enclosed it?
It's thirty feet.
I'm not.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
Thank you.
To check up on me?
You have everything?
You don't have a choice.
I'll hate you forever.
I warned you yesterday.
No.
No you don't.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
What do you know about me?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
That's so weird...
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
You lied to me!
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Good for you.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I need you to do me a favor.
I want you to find someone for me.
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
Why call me?
Money?
Where will you live?
I'm married.
What?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I dreamed about your house last night.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
This was my very first slow dance.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
Going on?
That was the truth.
You bit my finger.
What?
Not a perfect day.
You got any weed?
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The payoff.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We should take a vacation.
You can't go because of Sam?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Sam took them to a movie.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Why?
No.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
But you can't.
Is Spanky here?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
But I'm having a good time...
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Here I am.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I said you're soft.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
So?
I'm all right.
You killed Santa Claus?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Rayford!
I prefer bourbon.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Satchmo.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
...their damned souls will be ours.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It would be so okay.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not me, moron.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
I think you're looking at him.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Coulda been much worse.
You got it.
Beast.
What was it called, sir.
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
That way.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
See something you like, my man?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Anything to eat?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Up there.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Your own work?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Anybody we know?
I'm very smart.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Not about that.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
It's different now. Help me.
I let him go... believe me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Maybe you'll think of something...
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
They won't listen.
How will they know we're coming?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
I won't.
Of course.
It could be...
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
All this. All of it.
For as long as I can remember.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Okay.
What?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
What do you mean by that?
Right... This just glided along.
His or ours?
Yeah, I remember.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
We killed him.
Alice?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
No.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
No, sir, it's not.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
No... I don't. Why?
Who was the man?
I... I didn't say anything...
FUCKIN' "A".
The first night... Not the last two.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
A videotape.
No, nothing.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Thanks, guys.
What?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
What?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Sorry... I...
I don't know.
What night?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Come on.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
That's ridiculous.
Oh, really?
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Sounds like a stall to me.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Nothing. Why?
Leaving?
When are you going to start?
Well - I'm—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Thank you.
So there are others?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Suppose she should leave it?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Then it's done.
Pardon me—
Oh, dear.
Yes.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Do you think this will come in my time?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Oh, George . . .
She's going with me.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
Why?
I'd love it!
English!
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Yes.  Barney!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Cowan--
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
What happens if I say no?
Yes, sir.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Kay...
Sir, you can't just--
What?
We wear black.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
So what's the problem?
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Get back in the car!
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Kay!?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
They respond to fear, right?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
It's... coming.
What if I don't?
Scientific American?  Really?
May I have a look?
Come again?
Is it now?
Can you see the balloon man?
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She's still alive?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
I can't even stand up --
The nano... what?
-- go blind.  I know.
... Graveyard shift.
Try again.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Hang on, Lamar --
Yes, sir.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Everybody runs.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Run the subscription list...
No maglev system.
That was easy.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
They don't belong to anybody.
Tell me how.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The precogs were wrong.
Who said I would?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
You're not gonna kill me...
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Hold that thought.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Not.  Now.
I'll be right there.
None of your damn business.
He's my subordinate!
What?
How?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Right here.
Yes, I know.
I don't know, why?
How many?
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
I know who you are.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
To what?  Trap him?
But there's still the other two.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
You're Bobby, right?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
Bullshit.
No more.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
Who's watching the baby?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a good guy --
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
You driving her?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Quick drop. In and out.
That's it.
Me? No. Not really.
Pshhh...
What?
I know.
Ruiz knows about this?
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
What is it?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Well, this is the corner.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
It's not losing record.
Yeah. I know the number.
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Sorry coach.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You would think.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What's up?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
We don't need guns.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Where do you get this shit?
Easy...
Fuck...
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I didn't do anything --
Ugh...
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Here...
How's it going?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Word.
Yes, sir.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
What?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Just now.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You know it.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Then the devil is white.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
If you want to tell me.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Yes.
Yes. Did you eat?
Hush your mouth.
I'm not made of glass.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
What did I tell you about assuming?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Please, go ahead.
Let me do it then.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
Your control over your children, therefore --
No. You'll be marked for death.
And don't come back.
...That isn't a whore?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Am I a suspect?
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
It's a little late.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
I show, you give me the information?
[Daniel what?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Don't lie to me!]
It's loaded.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
What do you mean, I'm here?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Time will tell.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
Yes.
You need to practice.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
So are you.
I'm fine.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
It's Creasy.
What was her name?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
[No. Why?]
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
So am I.
Two tourists who never went home.
I can take care of myself.
Yeah, sure.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
Hiya, Ralph...
What nurses?
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
How you, Radar?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Home.
Hospital.
Pour one for Painless.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Duke Forrest.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You betcher ass, General.
I like an olive.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
No, no, that one.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
He can move in here with us.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Maria...
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You think he won't.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Second pint.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Homosexuality.
That. It's out of the act.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
No, thank you.
About me?
Thirty dollars.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A third party?
Mr. D. B. Norton!
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
A deal?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
Sorry.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
No.
He's watching the other door.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Go out and find her!
What?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
The heelots!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Huh? Get what?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Thanks.
Good night, John.
That's too bad.
How?
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You want me to go up with you?
Good. I don't want to be late.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Of course.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
You can't help me, man.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Is there a problem?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Being faxed over now.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Is that all?
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
If you say so.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
We could fill it with water.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
You living together?
Explain how that works.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Do you really?
No.
Yes.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Why?
You're a compulsive gambler?
Still needs work.
To run late!
Yeah, first and second.
He's cutting down the visibility.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I ain't interested in your life story.
You worship yourself.
Greg.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
If you did, you never showed it.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
What do you think would be in order?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Who's running it?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Yeah, they are but...
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
I need to take back what's mine.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
To live forever.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
About what?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
In here I am.
It's not real.
Yes...
We're going to have to reconfigure.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- He won't.
Where?
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
Yes.
Activated.
Checking connection.
What does that mean?!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
We can take these guys!
LET'S FLY!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
So they've been destroyed?
How'd you know?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Activating Power Scope!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
But I've never served a day.
Awwh, Charlie.
So what happened?
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Who hired the bastard?
I can just imagine.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Never threaten me, Boss.
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
I know about you.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
But that's an hour's drive.
The name's Charlie.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
I got partners.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Sad commentary, huh?
I didn't say anything.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
How much?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
YOU SET ME UP!!
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
What?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Mother!
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What does he do?
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
And where is she?
Yeah.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I did not--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Paine.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Waiter!
Have *you*?
We're gonna get married.
What?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Why me?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
Can't that wait, Hubert?
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Y-yes, Jim.
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Oh, a *boy*!
Than what?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Why, of course.
Uh--could--could I help--?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
For a question!
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
You're a liar!
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Most natural thing in the world!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
Yes, I see that.
The Steering Committee.
Try sitting down.
He did?
No.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Not another bill?
Thanks a lot.
Saunders--!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well--I--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
How's that, buddy?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Okay. See you here.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
It's crucifying him--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Sometimes twice.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Always.
I haven't.
Would you like to go for a walk?
No!
NO!!
Yes, but I—
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
What did they say?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What's that?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
I'll get my hat.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Let's just walk, okay?
A girl?
Yes, of course.
Nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
We're not going out tonight.
Hello.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Had the boys follow us.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Hurry up!
Boy, was he burning.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Better wire him right away, John.
What was that you said he was?
Proceed.
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
All right.
Yes.
Who - me? No.
What for?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Huh?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Huh?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Binge?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
South Dakota - but on the top.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Excuse me. What did you say?
I just wanted to make sure.
Prairie? Oysters?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
What two policemen?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes, sir.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Take your time.
Mr. Cook.
Uh-huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Not any more.
Ernest, what do you think?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Right now?
Are we?
My approach?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Now we're back on track.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
And the experiment is in here?
My pleasure.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Do you want to come in?
I've had my moments.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Oh?
I'd better get in there.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Where am I supposed to eat?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Mumford... like the town?
Mother... go away!
Oh... not a real doctor.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is she against you getting help?
Something's bothering her.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
I don't know if --
I don't follow you.
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
What?
Anything... just ask.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What happened today?
Was it something that happened at school?
Uh-huh.
Do you think that's what he wants?
What'd he say?
No again?
Really?
Is that the question?
I understand.
Uh-huh.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Yep.
Jerking off?
Just you.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
It wasn't the best situation.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
What'd I do?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
What?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You shall see.
That's one way of putting it.
Intestines.
Correct, And that's when --
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I am an English woman.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
I just decked your brother
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Oh that's comforting.
What are those mirrors for?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Very slowly.
That bad huh?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Still...
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
What's it look like!?
Yes,... I see.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I know you did.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I'm his daughter.
Atta, boy!
I'm the Bowler.
I got it.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Why?
Me, too.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
And you are a fool.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
But there's still only six of us.
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So you're chicken?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Wait!... Look!
Shhh.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Oh shut up.
The Eradicators!
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Oh hi, Mom.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Shut up.
The who?
Whatever our name is.
Through there!
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I did, sir.
May I come to the map?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Any cannon?
Where are they?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Properly arranged, yes.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
But who made this treaty?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
No, sir, none at all.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Four o'clock.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Of course.
Promises mean nothing.
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
Yes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Certainly.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
Yes?
Yes.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Of course, my dear.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Thanks, Unc.
You paid cash?
Good.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
What happen?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't know yet.
Me too.
Wait for what?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
What are you doing here?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I said hold on!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Well bring yo' ass on...
Come on.
Smokin' what?
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Nice to meet you?
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
This is a knock.
And some rolling papers.
Bite his ear!
He's a boy, dude.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What?
Yeah, and hurry up.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I got my mase.
What happened here?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
What?
Sorry.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
That's...a comfort to hear.
That's right.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Indeed.
For not believing you.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Tell me why I miss him.
Tell me why he's dead.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
All right.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Yeah, all right, listen...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah.
Thanks for the tip.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
I think this is worth a dollar.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Gimme a dollar.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I've done much better ones than this.
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
'Daddy has to go now.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
I'll bet.
Dad, you're bleeding...
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
About what!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Tricked us!
John don't like him much.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
There's something else.
You better not sing that song.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John, where are we g --
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Nothin'!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What?
Yes?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
No.
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Yes; from the first night.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Harry, what --
Yes.
Where's she at?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
What?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Jesus.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Slept like a rock.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
You do?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
'Anything funny' like what?
Krueger.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
The door was locked from your side.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
No.
He's nuts about you.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Naturally, Comrade.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I see.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Just for the honeymoon.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
With two f's, if you please.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
That's right.
I must be stern with you.
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Go to bed.
Eight forty-two, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Certainly.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Even the swallows are back.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
You believe in our cause?
But you had!
You're going to force us... huh?
What?
No.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Wounded? How?
It's false sentimentality.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Why?
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
Much happier.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
No, no music.
Yes, sweetheart. 
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
You can't imagine.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Has done what?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Thank you.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Where is it?
My jewels?!
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
So ... let's go ...
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
No, we have nothing to hide.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I'll bet he would.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
I thought the gloves were off.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
So?
And if I stay?
Lincoln used it.
I know it well, sir.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Silence!
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
Sir?
Money.  Follow the money.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
What ... ?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
The White House.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
What do you mean, Jack?
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
That'll be the day.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Yes, I understand that.
That's right.
Sir?
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
Is that the truth?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Don't be ridiculous!
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Who else'd be in your truck.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
You don't know what he thinks.
I'm... discouraged.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Llewelyn Moss?
You figure him for a dope runner?
No. Probably I don't.
I'm hidin' behind you.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I never do.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Well -- how come?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where it's going to be.
No me mate.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't need to talk to you.
So what're you goin' up there for.
I see.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
See about closing.
You live in that house behind the store?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Call it?
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Okay.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay. We can stop that.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
I don't know.
I got an overcoat on.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Little place called "Williams," why?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...to see you.
I am?
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I better go check on them.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
All the time...
Do what?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Didn't I?
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I came for love...
I don't know.
Make sure it's elevated...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Los Angeles, California.
That's horrible!
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
I'll go to the Hospital.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
God, that's awful!
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
I wanted to make a statement.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Should I kill him now?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Half.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I know that.
No.
What?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
I SAID FORGET IT!
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Uh-huh.
Would you say she was ambitious?
David Ravell.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Waitaminute -
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Gopher, Everett?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Fire! I hate fire!
Gopher, Everett?
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Where's Tommy?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Problem a p'seption.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
In any state.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
I been calling for four months.
Great.
Thank you, sir!
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
I joined the Navy.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Yeah, I know.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I wrote. Not every week...
Yes, Joe.
A long time ago.
Yes, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
No.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!!
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
I'm a little late, that's all.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
What?
One more minute.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Yeah... Mmmm...
You hope.
I haven't made up my mind.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Really?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
It sure was.
I'll get it if you want.
What's stopping you?
When I'm good and ready.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Your real father?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I bet you do!
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Yeah. All week long.
He said he grew up poor?
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
No problem, but who's Susan?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
That's right.
I have the gun.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
You finish.  Then we finish.
I know.
You're an idiot.
I did.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Can we come in?
We'd like to come in.
Huh?
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Open it.
I said open the door.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
The hell we are.
Why?
0150.
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Chills?
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Don't though. 
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
"Titanic."
On it!
He won't even know who it was.
He --
I was trying not to tell you...
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
What are doing with yours?.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
You know it brother.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
You know that's bullshit.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Look this is bull...
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
We need money first...
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
What are you saying?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
What?
Where is he?.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
No.
Thank you.
Uh... uh... I...
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
He's my father.
Do you?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Colonel will do.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Sir.
The middle colonies?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Is that so?
Yes...  ... father.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Where?
You know what happened.
That's right.
I don't care.  I hate him.
It's Mister Marion.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'm sorry.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Thank you.
Remember Braddock?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Sure.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Does she love the cat?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Why? For God's sake, why?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Because it's right.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
I got eggs down here!
That's forgotten.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Aye, aye, sir!
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
All right then.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
That so?
Aye, for us there is.
Or you could surrender.
Very well.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
It's a pirate medallion.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
I can't breathe.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes -- yes.
Ceremony?
Me!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
She can hold a bit longer.
What?  He never told me that.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Ah, but you have heard of me.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
How?  The key's run off.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
'Bootstrap?'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Jack!
It's the right way.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes, I have.
... No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
... no.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You're not rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Aaabout...?
The replicators?
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Who isn't?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Been out for six months now.
Same old Daniel.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
That's what I thought.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Yes.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
That was 'simple'?
What happens?
That's right.
What about it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Blame the victim.
What did you want my hair for?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Oh yes you are!
The question is, are you?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Goodbye, Stew—
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
How-di-do.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Good morning. What does this mean?
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I certainly will.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
Well - it's only April.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Your valet, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Yes.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Right!
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Right.
Right.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Holy jumping swordfish!
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Why—
With pleasure, Madame!
Yes, sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yeah?
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter.
We're in Pleasantville?
It can't be possible.
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
I'm sorry ...
Yes she is.
But I really should get home.
Oh, George ...
I don't want it to go away.
Um ... It's ...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Oh, no thanks ...
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
You're not allowed to lie.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Get lost!
What happened?
Owns the hardware store.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
What were you doing in a library?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
They just grow like that?
I'm not sure.
I like it too.
Nice ... Nice ...
Ooomph?
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Because we don't belong!
I can't.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Oh--well ...
I'm going to leave now.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Why?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
What?
Listen to me!
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Hi.
No, that's not it.
TV repair?
Yeah ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
That's it.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Did I say that?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I....please don't do this.
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah.....
No.
....what....?
I have to go.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
No.
Hi.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Ok.
Sure.
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
...yes I did...?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
This is Lena.
Yeah.
About six months ago. Why?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
What is this?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why?
Please don't do this to me.
Can I ask how much is this?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
What?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I didn't know you had a sister?
That was weird. I meant good.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Where you goin?
Ok.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
You have an ATM?
Alright, alright.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Nothing.
It's fine.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
Why not?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
You always do.
His rug.
Valcour. His chair.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Was it impotence?
Then it must've been love --
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
His wife's influence.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
He's sworn to obedience.
Oh indeed?
No. It most certainly was not.
What could cause a tincture like this?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
I don't believe it!
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Go on, child.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Forgive me, I beg you --
I wonder sometimes.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
I can't
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
And director.
I'll remember that.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
How much?
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir, I-
We're using-
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Uh-huh
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Can I talk to Hearst?
Forget it-
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Like a bug.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
And what does he see?
I don't care.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
It's too late. The movie's made
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Yeah, you're probably right.
Thank you-
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Jesus
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
No, we're jake. But listen-
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
It was fun, wasn't it?
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
About what?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
Nothing...
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Whadda you care?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
C'mon, Joey.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
You sound bitter.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I just wanted to say hello.
Can you see it?
Come over here.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Who asked you?
What did I say?
Positive.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I took the kids to my sister's.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What're you talking about?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I'm leaving you Jake.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Are you drunk?
C'mon, Tommy --
He should.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Excuse me for living.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Jefferies?
Namely?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
I was jaywalking.
Who left -- where?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
You figured that out, huh?
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
You did.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
It crashed, didn't it?
She expects me to marry her.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
How did you know!
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Smart girl.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Empty as a football.
Not too active.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Tired?
I wish there was one I wanted.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Three.
You mean "goodnight."
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Still -- those witnesses.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Your name?
Phone number?
Two minutes.
Somebody find him a knife.
Jim Stark.
Hi.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
You make any sandwiches?
Shoot, Jimbo.
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sure.  Sure.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
That's right!
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Do you hear from him, son?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
Jim.  What's yours?
They're still there!
What's a chickie-run?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Man, you're schizoid!
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Your father!
I'm here.
I'm fine.
No.  At dawn.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Just a guard.
Good Lord!
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Grandma?
And your folks didn't understand?
But you don't think that's a solution.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
"Life is crushing in on me."
Oh.
A what?
I'm not so bad.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I felt like it.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Are you?
You don't need to do that.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Hi.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
No.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Gabriel, let him go --
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Yeah.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
We could live it up and --
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
What's going ON!!!
Nick, I love you --
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You saved me.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
You shouldn't have.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
The hell I can't.
Wish I had a brother like you.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
I don't know.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
I said, who the hell made the map?
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
I'm no threat without a gun.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
And where they hide the real money.
I don't steal any --
GO!!!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
It's a roach, guy --
Ain't there yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
She set them up. All of them.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Now where were we?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
How do you know all this?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Yeah.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
It's a change.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Like hell I am.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Nope.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Down to my car.
You didn't ask.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Lie back down, and try to -
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Uh-uh, just cops.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
And one of 'em is sick.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
His letters will keep.
It's too light yet.
You're not going out to look for them?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
To the other side of the street.
I haven't got the job yet.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Like what?
I don't want to run short.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
I won't again.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Yes, people make me restless.
Depends on how good you drive.
I don't like to see you go.
Maybe in Sonora.
How many ways can a man say no.
That's it then.
Stop it --
Where is he?
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
I sure would.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
No.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
And you've got me all figured out?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Steve --
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Alex, what are you doing?
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hello Ray.
No, stay.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
It looks like the furnace.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I think so.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Not in a thousand years.
Yes!!!!
I'll go.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
I wouldn't go that far.
Who?
Saw who?!
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
In about fifteen minutes.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
That's why we came here, remember?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Just a little experiment.
You do.
That's right.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Second best.
My help?
I guess so.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Then let us prepare.
Because she will lie?
Dog, you look hot.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
"Fucked me."
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
No more violence... No more violence...
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
I certainly did not.
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Looks good, Mom!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
That's nice.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
GODDAMN YOU!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I certainly was not!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Yes, I was.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
What's he know?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
You can?
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I guess most people are.
I did her hair.
She showed me a drawing.
Yes.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Good night.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
I don't know.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Yes.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Devil worshippers!
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
Tell me what?
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
No. She's no longer under my care.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm afraid not.
That's too bad.
She's not been here for a long time.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Please.
What did he say?
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Why
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Who's Elizabeth?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Kids? What about them?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
You're in therapy?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Can we look at one?
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
She said it on her tape.
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
Not entirely.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Mmmmm...
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Yeah, so?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Did you masturbate?
So it was recently that you tried this.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Is he still at your house?
I guess.
Not really.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Well, what, then?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
You are in trouble.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Thirty-two dollars.
Okay.
Bye.
Did you take your clothes off?
Nope.
What do you get?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
When I was fourteen.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
So make an exception.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Could be risky.
In here!!
You know what I mean.
I want to see you.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Nothing wrong with trying.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
I just... Ann is very...
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
Will you lease month-to-month?
I like having the car, the car is important.
So is my wife, asshole!!
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
All right, jesus.
Hi. Want a drink?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Uh, OK. Sure.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Gonna cut me open?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
I don't get it.
OK. I'll think about it.
No? How come?
Huh?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
What's cookin', Bert?
What?
I got it!  I got it!!!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Absolutely correct.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
What does he know about it?
We love you, Baby.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Huh.
Gary.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
No, I'm an actor.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Um... seventy... something.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
It's not even a mile.
Uh-huh.
Then it's a good thing.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
And she likes Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Shut up.
So what's the plan today?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
What?
With Maya?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Okay! Jesus!
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Yeah.
You're an asshole.
Shut up.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
What's happening?
What exactly are we going to do?
Put me down, Jack.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Yeah.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hrnrnrn?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I'm fine. You rest.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
I finished it.
The Windmill.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Twelve months in oak.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Yeah.
Got it.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Yeah.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
She doesn't answer me either.
My ballet recital.
That's weird.
You love walks.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What time is it?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
From what?
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Graham.
Yes.
Oh.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Don't call me Father.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
No money, eh?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Sounds good.
Where were you?
That's why I'm here.
Yeah... that must have been it.
It's one thing to know it...
I haven't done anything.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
He is that.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
I understand.
Anybody got any ideas?
Yeah?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Why?
What's that?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
He is now.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Luck, I guess.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I run the place. What can I get you?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
Okay -- for you.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Not quite.
Impossible.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
It was a great show, Dad...
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I know what you mean.
I've seen them all before.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I don't know anything about computers.
You do?
You saw that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
Night, Lainey.
I know.  Thank her for me.
I could get the death penalty.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
The background is.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
My God, you've got one?
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You know what I'm talking about.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
I didn't leave you.
Tell me.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
I guess they don't.
I don't tell her a thing.
Who me?
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
What?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Don't get mad.
Dead people.
Got it.
I know.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
S-ssssstop it!
It's our pleasure.
J. C. Penny's?
What are you talking about?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Pardon?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Amends...?
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
What's wrong?
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
About what?
Nah. Just you.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Why bother?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Whatcha' doin'?
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Grant.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
I'm sorry.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
Yeah. Good.
Aspirin.
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Shut up.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
What?
How many you need?
Out.
You're pretty.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Okay.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
I give up.
Shoot.
Eleven.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
Like what?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
And?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Six. Got it.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
They're jammed!
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Not for long, you ain't.
Yeah, guy?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
We'll be waiting. Over.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
What's that, pardner?
Go breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Who's Fred?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Chickenshit money.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
What kind of personnel?
You have a butler working that floor?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Mortal.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
And threw us into the lake.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
You woulda?
Damn... alright then.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Okay.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...He does now...
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
A Fed? Like FBI?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
What do you want?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
Why, who did you see?
My wife.
To who?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
What do you mean?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What kind of look?
Yes.  Yes.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Rheya.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Rheya --
You should have told me.
Who are you, then?
I can't --
Fuck me.  I knew it.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I got money.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Sooner, the better.
How did you know?
But "nice".
Tell it like it is.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Oh God, that's great!
Yeah.
Long enough.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
So.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Claire...
Sure we are, let's go!
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Why?
I think -- she's crazy.
I might stop you.
I had to follow her to a store.
I'm sorry.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I'm all right.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
No, sir...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Okay, I guess.
Mom and I got plans.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
You stop him?
Remember Little League?
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Right.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Thanks, I already ate.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
What if you get hurt?
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Hi, Adele.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
I know what you mean.  I...
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Strong...
Why?
Nah.
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I will finish what I've begun…
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
What?
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Any news on Dunbar?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
We'll get some more.
In this barracks?
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Thanks.
Forget it.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
You are talking crazy!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Abfuehren!
Then droppen Sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
No?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
What do they always say?
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Why, sure!
Anything else?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Just what makes you so popular?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Thirty-fifth.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
A chicken?
Where is he?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
When is it expected back?
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
You get what?
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
One minute to warp core breach.
The station complement was nineteen.
All hands, brace for impact!
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
You're in the Nexus.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
All of us.
Yes, where would you go?
Please, please.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Better?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
I hadn't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
I thought you might.
I always do.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
No, I didn't know that.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Thank you.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Trilithium?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Lock phasers and return fire!
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Underground deposit?
... Or <u>who</u>.
Logic indicates that is the case.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir!
Just him, sir!
What? What are you saying?
You would have done the same for me.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Go, Sulu!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Indisposed, sir.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.

No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Yes... But -- how...?
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
How is that...?
Good for you, Lieutenant.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
I have my orders.
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
We appear to have plenty of time.
Only half of you would get there.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Spock?
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Aye, sir.
Not at present.
The word is given: warp speed.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Aye sir --
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
The ship -- out of danger?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
They just don't want us going in there.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Engage warp engines --
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Battle stations.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
... They do, indeed.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
-- That's the general idea.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
What do you think, Spock?
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
I liked him better before he died.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
We're just -- observing.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
You play games with me and you're through
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Go ahead.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Who do you think I am?
All right. The truth?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
A spaceship with a missing man.
... You have a point...
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
How do you know this...?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Why not?
Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
I will, Admiral.
Steady as she goes...
Picture, Uhura!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Yes, sir.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Humpbacked - people.?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
How long, Scotty?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Millions?
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Why?
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
... an offlander?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Sometimes I do.
Is it safe to move her?
Captain, Geordi...?
I don't know.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
May I talk to you alone?
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
If it works you mean.
Why not?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
We're through running from these bastards.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Aye, sir.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
You've not aged a day since then?
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
All ship functions are off-line.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I look forward to reading your report.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
But how?
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
Always am.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
<U>Engage.</U>
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
There's a few of us left.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
The invasion plans.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
On screen.
Onscreen.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Yes, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
We've been set up all along.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
That's a comfort...
You feign ignorance?
How can I trust --
He just tried to save him!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Well, I -
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up, Captain --?
Now we go to Starfleet?
ALL uniforms?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Do we report this, sir?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
They'll be here...
Candidate for what?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Right -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You hear that?
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
An error.
I don't want to.
You can't prove any of this...
We've been ordered to -
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Aye, aye, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
No.
For how long?
How long is that?
He turned out all right.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
On my way.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Negative.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
With pleasure, Captain.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How could I not?
Make it so.
Do you have life support?
Theories?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
On screen.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
On screen.
Still well on our side...
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
And the Romulans invade.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
You know that's not possible.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Please.
It is... invigorating.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Yes, Praetor.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!

And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I make maps.
No.
Stay right there...
About five miles back.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
They must have picked it up in space.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
No, we don't.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Minneapolis.
Space?
Three nights... two days.
No.
No.
No.
Is that a baby?
Why?
But I speak English.
I do not speak English.
Can I have the gun?
Goodbye.
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I am your friend.
Why?
Yes.
I do not want to.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
On the radio they say it's good.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
You promised.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Call the police!!
My grandmother's rich.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Sure.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
We're ready.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Twenty-eight years.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
No.
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
What're you going to do?
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
My God.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Thanks, Max.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
But this is a bad one.
W'sup, Max?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She's my destiny.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
It's not your fault.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Why?
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
I'm not going.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Yeah.  We did.
Take the tape to the cops.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
This isn't in our database?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What's wrong with me?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
What?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
How long ago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I didn't use Low's name.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
How long have you been downtown?
The other reason?
What's this country coming to?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I know.
What did you tell him?
Not the way I can.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
Sit back.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
The little piggie speaks.
Yes.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Zero killed them all?
I already have an employer.
Who told you about her?
Maybe you should back off.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[What does the file say?]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
It's over for you.
I know, I know.
I don't know about that.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...maybe...
What's that like?
You better pay the man.
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Tell me about it...
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
What an asshole.
Did you get it?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Listen. I had a great time.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...It's really getting late.
...The red piece of shit over there...
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Fine... I guess. You?
Really?
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Goodbye. I lov... 
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I do. Good for you, man.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What'd you get?
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Ah, there's the rub...
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I didn't make it...
He's trying to be an actor.
You asshole.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
You think they're watching?
I know, but...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's just leave.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
We didn't do so bad after all.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Hold on.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What?!?
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
What was cold about it?
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Six.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Yeah.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
And with prison record.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Barzini.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
No.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
You want him to stay in this country.
Where are you going?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Mike!
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
We're all tired...
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Did he give you his politicians?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Michael...
Sure.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Let HER ask.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
Cut it out.
The kid's right.
I do wish to be baptized.
He talked to you?
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You're unlucky.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
No, still here.
Can you mix a martini?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Your parents met her.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
I played piano in a few places.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So tell me.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Such as?
Bird. That's jazz.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
I'm fine.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
What does that mean?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
And you, sir? Any better?
I can explain.
Shut up! Shut up!
Why? When?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
What?
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
You know what -- I am.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
A ragione. A ragione. 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Thanks.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
It's okay.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I'll fix some drinks.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Yes?
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Even your fiancée...?
What about Thomas Ripley?
31 people.
That's an expensive gun.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Who mam?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
Oh. Who was that again?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What's wrong?
My God!
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
With who?
This is gotta be a game, right?
With the other hand, right?
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
And what happened?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You can do it in my mouth.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
It happens.
You want to talk about it?
You know how I feel about what you do.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
You suppose?
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
It's all I could think of.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
And  I love you, Pete!
Delly?  In here.
You mean,  me?
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Well... where can we go?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
And why not?
Yes.  Hic!
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
I don't smoke?
Guess I must've learned.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
By all means.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Harry, son.  Harry.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Yes.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Pete...
She's very pretty.
We live in a theater?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Can we get him to the hospital?
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Who the hell is this "they?"
It's wrong, Leo.
Well, that's not what they think.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
When was that?
No.
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Cat.
I thought you...
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
The war...
Yes.  Very.
Yes?
It's a lovely garden.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
I think so.
I despise it.
Different?
Because she was afraid.
She already has a daughter.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Then go.
Cathy!
Well, I suppose...
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I don't know yet.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Birds are not bad!
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes, very.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
I know, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I got them all, Mother.
I don't know.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
You're doing fine.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
I started to say... inside...
No, not exactly.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
We know what it is, Al.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Monday?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
Criminal.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
Seven o'clock then.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
Yes.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
What do you want ?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
What do you do?
No, tell me.
Growing a beard...
Hear, hear!
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What were the crows after at the school?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course.
Then let's go. Now!
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I want you to help my little girl.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
MacFarlane
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
Burke them?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye.
You sent them. I had no choice.
You're wrong.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I think we should get some support?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
I don't know you, man.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Your father gave them to both of you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
No! Why are you haunting me?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Yes I do, I really do.
It's not. I can't take it.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Not tonight. Honest.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Looks like you have them both on.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I leave that in your hands.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes.
Yes -- of course.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Of course, dear.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
All right.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Just Klaatu.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Thank you... Have you any news?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
It won't work.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
I'd give you a very good price.
You don't.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This one could save your life.
He's my brother.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<u>Four</u> to go.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
What?...
Hey, take it easy.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I can't do that!
How do you know they're not?
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
Sam, don't --
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
No.  I'm up.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Gotta go, Mom.
What's that smell?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
He's already gone to bed.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Must be a circuit breaker.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Okay.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Because I love you...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Take laddie.
Save Laddie first.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Nowhere.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  On the phone.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
What about Mom?
Huh?...
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Maybe.
So what's our problem?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Cool it, Palmer!!
Hell no.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Was dark... find a light...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
It's shorted out or something!
Look, I'm just guessing...
What?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
We ain't buying that.
What for?
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
Thank you.
In this weather?
A couple of hours.
That far?
Well, stick to it.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Move it, Palmer.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
The generator!
Then we go after him.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Hear what?
I had an accident.
On the towers?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
Where?
But you're only a mud carrier.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Last night.
What?
It frightens you.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes.
This way.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox...
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I just love mechanical things.
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
I mean... well... affection.
A moonstone.
Got here as soon as I could.
I need... to talk to you.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Do you know you were humming?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
What is it?
I would.
I'm glad.
Sir...?
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Good night.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Every night.
Yes.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Go back to your own time?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Tell him to go away --
I see.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Do they?
New Yorkers.
No...
Why?
New Yorkers.
I suppose so.
Kalen...
They're inside --
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
And what does that mean?
He didn't either.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
That's too bad.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] What?
How?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
William, you're not making sense.
To the hospital.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I could try to...make it stop.
Why?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
I'll die either way.
Maybe.
How...how do you know?
You still don't believe me, do you?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Thanks.
[Beat] I do it.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
How are things goin' out there?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
Oh, great.
Oh, definitely.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
What the fuck is going on?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Maybe.
Why now, Jimmy?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Okay.  I will, too.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Get the car!
West.  Left.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
She thinks he's a pig.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
What for?
Let's get it over with.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Just past Boise City.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
I can see that.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Sorry!
Yes.
Just asking.
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Good.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
You too, sweetie, the best.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Where?!
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Grrrreat!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
I'll try to be more careful.
I guess.
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
He implied it.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Good-looking?
Loser? You?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
I am?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Jesus Christ you're right.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Thanks.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
No thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
What's that?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
No, I mean
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Deco.
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Huh?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You're a sick man, you know that?
What?
Harvard?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Hm?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
He's no Steve Young.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
No, it's an old football injury.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Oh... are you... ?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
All right, let's go.
Mary, come on...
Okay.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
I think a little of both.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Smoke.
Cuba.
Yes it is.
Yeah.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
I, uh...
What about you? Where are you going?
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Rug samples.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
James Looks Twice?
Oh, yeah -- right.
It ain't Geronimo.
Good. Thank you.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Watch out!
You've got no jurisdiction.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He knows me?
She's your sister?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Crow Horse, listen --
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
It's not that.
Yeow!
How did you know this was my car?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
It's classified.
Where were you?
You let me make a fool of myself.
The what?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
What plane.
You're an animal.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Winston Churchill.
And now?
You always get what you want?
Anything.
Why?
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
What?
Hardly ever.
It does.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
How does it go?
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Your watch.
I was, later.
Well?
No sir! But you have to be ready.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
YEAH, COUGAR?
These guys are getting on my nerves.
What is?
No! Now we're inverted!
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
NO. NO GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Okay.
Just relax.
But I have to!
Well what?
Any more MiGs?
On what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
So's my Johnson.
Who's your pilot?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Right.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
What'd you do?
Don't.
What now?
SHIT!!
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
No. You can be mine!
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
So have I.
What the hell you doing?
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir!
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
I'm nothing like him.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
The Last Resort.
And you get a kickback.
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Get it, please.
May I use your pen?
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
I am Quaid.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I know that.
Yes, sir.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Eight years.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
O.K., everybody pull out!
You tell me.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
C'mon!
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Harry!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Up!
Come on!
Quit while you're ahead.
Mmmm.....
You know I do.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Oh God, Doug.
Bullshit.
Mars.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I saw them.
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
It's just up ahead.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Adios, bridge!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Little sons of bitches.
I think we wait right here.
Right.
I'm gonna help you.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Civil?  I'm civil.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
I know about Esparza.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Shut your sewer mouth!
Not necessarily...
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
No. No...
I specialize, Roger...
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
"Have to"? No...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
-- Yeah?
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I don't need sleep!
Want to tell me what went down here?
About Chinatown. What went down.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
It was self-defense.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Y-yes, sir.
Don Reynard.
Shu Kai Kim.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Badgering.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- Eddie told you?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
-- Every word.
That's right.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
For control of the prison drug trade?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Shu's the only one I know of...
And you b-believe that.
Blonde.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
You killed Mike.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Thank you, Carl.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Smell something fishy, huh?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
No, sir, we did not.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
How do you figure?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Well, why not?
No, I want to smoke.
If I can smoke it.
Nothing.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I can't help you there.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
No... No...
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James...
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
See what?
Hiking?
I understand.
What were you doing in my room?
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's a school night... back by nine.
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
No.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Oh, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Gruber...
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
No.
Yes.
I...
I... yes.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...We did everything we could...
I completely understand...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Overruled...
The TV didn't work.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
And what makes you so tough?
Mr. Alito, please.
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...I know. I went...
Yes. Yes, I have.
...fifty thousand dollars?
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Yes.
He's not in, Sir.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What?
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
You use their witness.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Yeah. I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
The broad has disappeared...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Should I?
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
But I think I know where she'll be....
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Would you like some coffee, General?
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
Don't you live at home?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
Right.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
So?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Everything is not fine!
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Say how they find their way back home.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
It can be captured, sometimes.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
Black's fine.
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
Claiming their place in the world.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Believe what?
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
What's the difference?
We all have problems.
Forget it.
Come on man, what'd they look like?
I can't make it out?
Yes sir.
Speak up boy!
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sir...?
He killed the dolphin.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Twice.
I know.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
They'll know about it in the morning.
Why would you do that?
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
You know what he is talking about here?
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
You've gotta be kidding?
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I don't know...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
This be it?
We don't have no paper bags.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Ready for another?
Have now.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Used to.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Set one up.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't say, which one?
How's that?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
That bastard Pucinski...
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
You up for that?
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Got anyplace special in mind?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'm goin'.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Uh huh.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Under a hundred.
That'd be good, Lula.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
One bad car accident...
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Went with Bobby.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I didn't see nothin'...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Isn't she?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Shut up and drink.
He heard everything we were saying.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Where would we go?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Ye-es?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Call it a hunch.
That was MacCaulay.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Shoot.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
You're in Kinship?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Yea?
A little.
Miss Sloviak's.
You're welcome.
I put you on the floor.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
That's a big book you're writing.
Blocked.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well done, James.
Yeah, well, actually...
Kinship.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
I didn't mean it that way.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Do?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
It beats 'What's your major?'
I got the message you called too.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
All right. This morning --
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Is the thing -- is it over?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Really, Sara, I...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
James Leer.
Grady.
I think I might have.
He told me.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
And you're old.
Why yes. How did you know?
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
I'm not sure that's possible.
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
This is important.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Her husband.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I might have his number on campus.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You want to keep him happy.
Beautiful. How's business?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Huh?
Yeah. It's really nice.
It was a beautiful present.
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
No thanks.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Is that right?
Who said I wanted to buy it?
You can't talk to me like --
I fell asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Why's that?
Can I ask how old you are?
Do you have many friends?
How come?
They sound like finches.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
No way.
Reflect.
No fucking way.
It's okay.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
We have a lot of work to do.
What did you want to happen?
I said I was sorry.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
It was a small house.
People without cars.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Sorry.
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
Yeah?
Why do you want to know?
I suffer from insomnia.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
I was always the one seduced.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
You must hate your brothers.
Not ever?
What's it look like?
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Piece of cake, baby.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Your rig?
Not for long.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
What do you think he saw?
Cute, Virgil.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
How?
We've only got one suit.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Got it. Over.
Missed what?
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
How deep?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And how do you explain that?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
But then when will we see each other?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Aren't you going to change?
Late, very late.
You say that just to flatter me.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Yes, we will.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Who tells you these things?
Dear Jesus...
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
No.
They were stained.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Oh, there are so many.
At least once a week.
Would you like to talk about it?
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Agnes...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No... do you?
I don't know.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
I don't know.
No.
Because I don't want one.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Everything... I don't have children.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Yes.
... makes me...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
And then...
No I'm not.
To help me.
Of what?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Because I wasn't worthy.
I'm afraid.
Someone's following me.
What do you think it's there for?
Yes.
Yes.
How did she know about him?
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Marty, what are you doing here?
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
When?
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Uh huh.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
What's your opinion?
That's ridiculous...
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Nothing.
Was the child full term?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
About what?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Oh, dear God.
I knew that after the fact.
Because I didn't know... 
Nothing...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
All right?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Long, thin and filtered.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Listen to her singing.
You're what?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
You think she's a saint?
How  ?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
This is insane.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
The scandal...
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
We'd be thrown out.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Y'what?
Are you now?
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
The police station.
They'll be here.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Spoil sport!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I'll have a bash.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Have I said something amiss?
No, straight up.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Ah well. Eh, look!
He's sulking again.
You crawler.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Books are good!
Yeah ... that's right.
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What?
Have they?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Lip reading.
Eh?
But I'm clean.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
So's mine.
You needn't bother.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
What have you heard?
Is it? Is it really?
Oh, leave off!!!
He'll get over it.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
A proper Aborigine.
Is that you, Roby?
Kill drive engines.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
But functioning.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Play it for us, please.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Hard to say.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Right.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I kind of like it.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Poison gas...
No, I don't want us separated.
Right. 
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
No.
Hey!  what about the film?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
Is it armed?
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Yeah?
Engine room, what happened?
Good!  Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Anything else?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Good.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
Right now let's keep it closed.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
So the next step should be --
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Who gets the privilege?
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
Sure.
Wait a minute.
Oh man...
Okay, give me the numbers.
You win some, you loose some.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Match it!
Yeah?
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
Just behind us, over to the right.
It's alright, it's cool...
Couple more seconds!
Sounds great.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
You've checked that end?
What?  Why?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Only six?
Want some?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Hold on...
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
What can I do?
No!
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Why'd call me a killer?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
What else?
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Yes, Addison.
Yes, Addison.
You're being childish.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Where?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
When - when are you coming back?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
See you...
It won't play.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
I don't think that's funny!
Twenty minutes!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
- guilty.
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Who?
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Don't calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Glory Hallelujah.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
What would you like? Texas?
I just wondered.
Why.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Also Addison deWitt.
From what would I be running?
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
No thanks, Birdie.
Of course!
Oh-oh.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
Don't be dense. The party.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
Probably not.
What report? To whom?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Oh, no. I see the play.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Hollywood.
I won't forget.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
'Remembrance'.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
They're your fans, your audience-
Three or four miles...
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
I just can't believe it.
Check.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
In a minute...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve?
That was a pity...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
Nothing much. She apologized.
That was way back...
What is he talking about?
I have no intention of having an accident!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
But that was the fourth straight time.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
A couple of weeks.
But what could she do?
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I promise.
I didn't hear you.
Yeah?
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--a spy, you mean?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Nixon.
You voted for him.
--shit--
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
If he self-destructed.
--'cause I only know four chords--
We're inside the White House now.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
11:30.
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I've got a lot of energy.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--so?
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Where are your bills, Carl?
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
There's always a later plane.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
What do you want to know?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
I will not talk about the other two.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Go on.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I'm not here.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
To where?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
No.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
I did all right on McCord.
You can't believe that.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
--go over your sources again--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Thanks coach.
Sorry, coach.
Sure.
Suck me...beautiful?
...okay...
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn't --
You can call me Oz.
Forget it.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What's that?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Of course.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
After getting laid?
I thought so.
Me?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Uh...yeah...sorry.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
You want to do it?
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Me too.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
No shit.
Yep.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Also like sex with my wife.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Looks like he lied to you too.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Then come find me.
Come out! I can do alterations.
Yes, your highness.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Ah! Let us begin!
It worked in Odessa...
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
Rasputin!
Promise me she'll have her home.
You gave the orders!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy Singer over here!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Me? Oh, downtown!
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Okay.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
think that's, uh-
No, so help me.
It's terrific.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
As Balzac said...
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
Yeah.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Mine.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Who cares? Who cares?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
G-go on, I'm interested.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Yeah?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
It's for my complexion.
W-w-whatta you mean?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
I'm cool.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Step up here!
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Tell him.
Hey.
Yeah, I love it there.
Whatta you mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
You'll total the whole car.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Jesus.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
She was stealing.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
I just have time to get the, uh-
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Hey-
Oh.
Oh yes.
Why didn't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
Why last?
And you've only just met.
October-ish.
It's alright, isn't it?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
He's allergic.
To dander.  Otis.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'd say it was down.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
It's not going to come up.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Don't you miss it?
Really.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
And you're not the wife.
Fuck you.
Anymore.
You really need to be fucked.
Nice to meet you.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Not as a rule.
I don't think so.
I love you, you're a genius.
I adore him.
He's directing now.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
Through the sweats or not?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'll say as little as possible.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce?
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
That is not true.
It's a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I'll never forgive you.
It's a Calder.
Oh, you know, I am.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
You're an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Very well put.
What?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I'll be your best friend.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
I'm sorry.
And he doesn't smoke?
You must have been a baby.
Sorry?
Clair is a hovering mother.
I'm sure you understand.
He always has two or three going...
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
God willing.
Why?
Let's just go home, okay?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Yes.
Oh?
Oh?
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It could be worse.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
That's not an answer, is it?
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
And here they are!
I hope they're watercolors!
Would you like to meet my husband?
I thought it was okay where it was.
So how much do you hate her?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
Not nice.  Not kind.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Hlllllllp!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
There's something going on, Z --
Oh no...
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Superior numbers, kid!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
No, sir!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
Yeah.  How much?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Oh!
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
How many of those drinks did you have?
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Let me help you.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
In his apartment.
They had to pump it out.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Give what up?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
A bad insurance risk?
Was he really upset when you told him?
You really think so?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Sure.
For me?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
I guess so.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
You usually eat alone?
What?
I don't?
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Yes, sir.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
What do you want?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I have a vague idea.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Kubelik -- with two k's.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Happy New Year.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
Not particularly.
Good night.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Get more coffee.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Let me take that.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You know I do.
I promise.
Yeah, we better.
All set for what?
Baxter?
Sssssh.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
What gives?
It won't happen again.
Oh -- oh!
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Well --
We need all our fuel.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Part.
None.
Sort of.
Tracks ?
A long time.
Call me what, sir?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Not a thing.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Let's go.
Shot himself. What for ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Yeah, it still runs.
We ain't goin' down the river.
This gentleman or myself ?
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Your daughter.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
What?
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Haiphong.
Who knows.
I met him.
Who?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Yes, I know.
Yeah, I like it...
You can't have water after morphine.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
No -- leave it --
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
That's me.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
No. Not really.
Yes.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Anyone got a card?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Son of a bitch, sir.
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Needs patching.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
175  CONTINUED:
168  CONTINUED:
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
She's dead.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
It's exactly what you meant.
Come here...
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
My home is here.  With you.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
New to the country, kid?
A daughter in Oregon.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Don't bet on it.
You don't know how true that is.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Nothing personal.
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Get the fuck out of here.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
Go ahead.
I love you.
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Since forever.
Yes.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
No.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
My son is sick, okay?
How do you know about my mother?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Yes.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
You take off when you have to.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
No.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Yes. I really would.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
I'll take care of myself --
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
What?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Ask him.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
I'm coming.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Absolutely not.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
I know you're going to jump.
I ain't scared of you.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Sure.
The contract was stolen.
I know.  It was a joke.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
Yeah.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
'Them'?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
We don't have a choice.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
He was killed.
Why not?
Ahhhh...
What?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
For Nicholai?
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
So?
How do you know they're not?
What?
Thank you.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
I'm not normal.
Yes.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Electra --
Honesty.
Do you believe that?
I hope not.
It's a common question.
Average.
You mean quit?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
I have all day.
A coke, if they have it?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
It's big, right Jahn?
Thought of everything haven't you.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Can you do the lock on it?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Have you ever stolen anything?
They'll never get us.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Who put a bee up your butt?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
What?
I fell in love.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Tell me some bad news?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
You're kidding.
Good, what's his number?
Some deal you did there!
What?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
So am I.
Yes.
No!
No!
Sure. Excellent.
Really?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
Whatever!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
No way Doug, I can't.
Fernet and tonic.
Thanks.
I hope so!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How?
What for?
We don't need you.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
No, just a coffee.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Sure!
Hmm, I still owe him.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Fuck you!
No!
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Just yesterday.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
With you.
And I have no idea why.
I don't want his money.
-- I like the car I have.
I could take after Dad, too.
Landon --
Demented.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I don't want to have any conversation.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Looking for something -- someone.
The dirty snowball at its core.
You don't believe in anything?
It's not.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
What are you talking about?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
You planned this --
What about your father?
I don't care.
Yes, one of many.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
No.
No. I want what's best for you.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
That won't be possible.
Like what, sir?
Your parents are divorced?
I'm not tired.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
She did. It was you.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
You came here to give me my report card?
Scalene?
What do you want, Biff?
No....
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
No!
Not now....
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
I'm going to be at the dance.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
What's this all about?
Pro! Release the rope!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Then where the hell is he?
So what? We'd be rich!
Marty.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
What if you lost your keys?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Perfect...
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Sure,.
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Yeah.
They come with the house.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
He never bit me.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Tom...
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What'd you come out here for?
What're you doing?
What's your friend's name?
Holly.
What for?
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Great.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Don't ask me.
What?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He was nervous.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Excuse me.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
How about over here?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Yes.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Hold it right there.
Wanta sue me?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Vanished. Thin air.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Let her out. In my custody.
Where's the professor?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Go where?  Where're you going?
Damn John Whorfin--!
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
Please, Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Stop it, Bill!
Drown all those rascals...
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Who?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Yes... Isn't it?
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Charlie. How are you.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
We gotta call the police –
Yeah.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
I'm at the Earle.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
The others are being sent.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Excellent picture.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Did you find out about her parents?
Bring 1976 up.
No, Nick, please --
No.  I mean it, thank you.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Put your hands up!
Yes.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
I have nothing to hide.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No, thanks.
Didn't you study it in school?
No.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Make love to me.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
No?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Come over here and tell me no.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I hope I helped you out.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
What is it you got between you?
Somethin', though.
You don't like punk rockers?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
I'm going with you.
Yeah.  I know.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
What was it?
On what basis?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Can there be some mistake?
No. Should I have?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Let's get out of here.
What's wrong?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Annina Nosei.
Aren't they?
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You name it, I paint there.
How about right now?
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
I didn't see you.
I need a dealer.
I hate this. Turn that off.
What?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
About what?
Oh – you mean black people!
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Hi Gina.
For real?
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I guess you did.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
You want some?
I hadn't thought about it.
Staten Island would be ok.
George?
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
Thanks
Have a Mac.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
I didn't know.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
I'm -- sorry, I --
Maybe you're right.
Yes and no ...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
PMS.
Silent night, violent night...
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Actually, it's a lot like that.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Too late for what, dear child?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Pheromones?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Hey, what's your problem?
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I can make it.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Maybe he melted.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
She wants to kill you.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Our work?
I think they're getting worse.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
What did you say?
No. You said I. I killed them.
He ran away?
The _Rolls_?
Dr. Meridian...
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
What?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Nostrovia.
Banzai.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Not much.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
I'm sorry. Who are you?
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
What the hell is going on here?
I got family. ...Please.
Never heard of a double-cross?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
A man with a death wish.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
You're a genius.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
... Very good, sir.
WHICH CAR?
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
As far as I know.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
... Looks like a convention.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Finding out where she is.
WHAT?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you, scared of heights?
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
What?  I improved her a little...
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Allie, he's not.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Excuse me.
Ahm.....
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Well, Ahm....
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Er ... pray tell me why?
Certainly is.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Okay.....
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
You mean there's mre than one?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh...
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
What's your problem Beavis?
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That's better. Yes?
Not now Bork.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Two hours.
That's how long you were gone.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
He might have hurt somebody.
Little black party dresses?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
<u>Out</u>.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
About what?
And live in what, our station wagon?
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
They're dead.
I want to get in.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
That's it!
... I will.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Otho, can you do it?
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
I thought I saw something.
Viridian?
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I see.
... Straight out?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, I will.
Yes, Robert. I will.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch.
Hello, Eve.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes, very well, thank you.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
I see, Ben.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
No, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Oh, I see.
Yes.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
I never needed money.
It's very sore.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
... Good evening, Louise.
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. It is.
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
Which view?
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
No.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I said - try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Mr. Gardiner...
Okay.
Who am I thinking of?
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Please, have a seat.
The monkey.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
I'm scared.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
Me and John.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
I said "yes."
Yessir.
I wouldn't know.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
It better be.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Hush, sweetheart.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
I like that.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
Fork ah did?
Says who?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Count me in.
No.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I love you, Lotte.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Great then.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
I likes yellow.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
Was a time I knew what was.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Thank you.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
In case of what?
Extra?
Go upstairs I said!!
Mama?
He's sleeping in the church.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
I run him off.
That's so.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Never found out.
No use thinking these things now.
What yard? When who-
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
You got to get up from here, girl.
She left me. She's gone again.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Oh, man, don't say that..
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Nothing.
And this guy peed on it.
Where's your car, Dude?
Uh-huh.
No--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Lebowski on the right?
Far out.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
And the, uh, the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
I thought you might know, man.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
He fixes the cable?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Maude?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Huh?
Hey Walter--
No, you're not wrong--
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Huh?
Walter, please--
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
The nail polish, Walter.
But Walter--
Dude--
The bulk of the series.
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Yeah.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Then what's...
Wha.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Are you employed, sir?
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Dude.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Well we--I don't--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
I haven't forgotten.
I'll heal.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Getting your attention, Paco.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Scud.
Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Are we bringing home strays now?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong.
Take him.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You're blind --
I'm sorry, I --
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Preventive medicine.
There is no cure.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
I know. Take some of my blood.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
You're a week early.
I don't believe that.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Get away from him!
You've been listening in the whole time?
He killed them?
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Yes.
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
So whoever built this--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
I don't know. Nightmare.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
I know, I know.
You have to go.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--fuckin' A right--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Ask me what I don't have.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
Fucking owl!
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
How's she going to know where to--
--Domini!
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
I'm not finished.
--now there.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
I think it's time to get out of here.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Ah, Domini?
No. I don't think so.
--and we brought it back with us!
....I don't know.
That's why she kills children.
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Yeah.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Yes.
No, I--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Sort of...
Yeah.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
You're bad.
Yeah.
Marty.
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
I don't follow baseball.
About ten years.
Ever durned one.
...Friday?
Lubbock?
...Hell.
I didn't say that.  Well?
What do you think?
So it would seem.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Has Ray come in yet?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Meurice...
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
What's that?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Yeah.
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
. my bourbon.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
Nobody.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
See my nipples?
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Sure I do.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Sometimes I think I do.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. it's okay.
Don?. Where is he?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Maybe so.
Where are they?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Are you sure?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
He got a little jealous.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
What is it?
Where to?
Okay.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Hey Jeff.
uh uh.
This is it.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Yeah, I know.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
What is?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Excuse me?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's your grass.
We want some grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
No fucking way.
Get me a six pack.
What?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Good night.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Okay.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
But to the victor belong the spoils.
We're half a million off.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Today.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Actually, it was three.
Un sapo?
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
That was a beautiful message.
Figured what out?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
I said, I've seen it before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
You swear?
But I've got school.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
And here?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Good evening, sir.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Good evening, sir.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
It could've happened to anyone.
So -- where do we start?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Thanks, Mister D.
Then you can go.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes.
Increase his heart rate.
No -- never.
You may call your next witness.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
No.
No.  No, I don't.
Yes.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
Then -- those are not your own words?
We dated for about a month last year.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Then you would have gotten your money?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You take a lot for granted.
Of course.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
That wasn't the deal.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Yeah.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
How often do you use cocaine?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
He could let you have your vacation.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
No.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
No treasure maps, huh?
He's not coming.
Come here a minute.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
'82.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
You want me to call the doctor?
Yeah.
Maybe it's because I live here.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Sure.
Oh. How old?
Must be nice having kids.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
I think so.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
You want to go back in?
What?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Yes! Hi.
No. I was just... No.
Yeah. See you later.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Nobody's asking you to.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Long day. Go to sleep.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Yeah. It could get better.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Frannie.
Nah.
They're not going to find her!
Cremated?!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
WHAT!
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Who?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Mother!  No.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Let me see it.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
No thanks.
Should I?
All right!  Where's the key?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
It was him.  I'm positive.
The money?  The money's gone.
This is insane!
Caesar ...
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What?
Everything you couldn't.
They were in a car accident.
I'm listening.
Sure.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
No.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
...  thank you.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
You're doing everything yourself?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
You have to ask?
Yes, it is.
I'm not afraid of anything.
What the fuck was it?
Is that what you think?
Good.
Johnnie?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
If he does ...
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So it's time to go home.
We have to go home, Jason.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Look, maybe I should just...
-- sir? --
Did you?
Excuse me?
Oh, Jesus... 
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
Listen to what you want.

There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
Go back to the hotel.

xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
I'm sorry.
Abbott wants to talk.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
<u>Where am I</u>?
I told you.  You need to rest.
Thank you.
...elephoned sir.
Got there!
...Yer nostril?
... yer ducts.
What? How do you know my name?
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Her name is Jill.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Well ... well, I ...
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Jack!
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
How do you mean?
Not really, no.
So how ...?
He's a freelance subversive?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
I do. Goodbye. 
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
What?
Information Adjustments.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Who are you?
No.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
A heavy Christmas present.
Looking for you.
Really.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Who will?
Oh God! What have we done?
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Are you sure?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Don't worry.
Really.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
27156789/074328/K.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
What?
You are good to me Sam.
I did it for you.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Yes.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry but ...
What is it?
Mother!
Actually, I've decided ...
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Um ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Er, yes ...
Thank you for calling Cen -
No, sir.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Who fixed your ducts?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
She say she in great pain.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He flipped out.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Just take it easy.
No.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
He's going to be all right, right?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
What did you say?
No, I'd better not.
Oh man, Bucky.
What?
John, play the Sinatra.
You look so different.
Okay.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Fifteen minutes.
I need to sit down a minute.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I think the worst is over.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Thanks.
That's too many.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yes.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Look out!
I never felt better in my life.
Better bring it all.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
How's he doing?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Let me think.
You're crazy.
No shit.
What?
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Relax, will you.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One more time!
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Nice, Jane.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
And the rule was...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What?
No?
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
They booted me out of Washington.
London.  That's a promotion!
Yes.
Why do you say that?
Good night.
Not because you have to.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You too.
Then it went well.
I'm not kidding.
No!!!!!
This is important to me.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Yes.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Follow me.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
That's okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I trust you.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
How's it going?
Yes.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Who?
Uh-uh.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Yes.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
You fucking...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I can't be.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
I'm going home!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I didn't finish talking to you!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Oh it's enough...
You're breaking my concentration!
Anything new?
Carla...
Better!
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Forget it.
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
I'm honored to know this man.
What are you doing here so early?
Leonard, what are you doing?
I'm totally serious!
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Nothing...nothing at all.
Why not?
I do the research.
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Put it down, Walter.
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Uh, sure.
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Gee.  Thanks.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
I was just straightening up the place.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Bummer metaphor.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
I mean it.
Hi, guys.
Maybe.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
It's the news, Buffy.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
So I noticed.
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I am so sure.
Not exactly.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
No, you're not.
Yeah?
I know.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
What for?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Like my homework.
) What do you think?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Where?
Get out of my facial.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
She --
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We'll cover it later.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Your turn.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
I guess.
Nicole...
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl.
Got that.
No --
Buffy?
Nee sitch.  No way.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Oh, please.
Okay.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
I am.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
My right nostril?
It's all the same thing.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
You can't seduce me.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I did.
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Yep.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Who?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I can do that, too.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He looks great, just great!
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Beg me!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
But he ain't seen my heat--
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Jesus.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Let go of me!
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
You too...Meat.
And where can I go?
I ain't hitting a man first.
Can I give you my testimony?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
Yes, you were.
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
All right, take care.
Wait, hold on a second.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Okay.
I don't know.
Matter of fact...
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Listen...
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Hey, Rich.
Yeah?
Hey, she came to talk...
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
What are you -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
It's me.
Well...
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
How do you do?
No, that's quite all right.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
What can I do?
Ace, listen to me.
What is it?
See you, Ginger.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Okay.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
...they didn't know what really moved her.
No.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
What? What?!
Okay.
I don't need one.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
What's it...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Yeah.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I threw it away.
What did Jennifer have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I can back him off.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I should have -
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Not gonna let me in?
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
You're firin' me?
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
A record of the arrests...
Green?
Can't do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
What?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You can't talk to me like...
Pitch-black?! It -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Okay.
Now move along.
I did - I didn't -
Fuckers!
Yeah. Fuck him.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Calm down! Calm down!
Stay out of the way!
What?
I'll tell him, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Ma che cazzo!
Yeah.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
All right?
It's all right.
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
What about my money?
All right. Be careful.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Thank you. Very nice.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
No, I'm gonna drive.
All right.
You know why, right?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
You jag-off.
She asleep?
Stacy. 
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Charlie M.
Yeah.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Mr. Chairman -
Oh, sorry -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You are right. What can I...
Having a good time?
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
She has a real spirit.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
I still have one left...
You can't get away with..
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
What's the good news?
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Uh. "Thanks?"
Enough.
But of course you are.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Thanks.
Where do you think you're going?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Theo wants to talk again.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Why would I do that?
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
What do you keep making me out to be?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Will you let me explain!
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
Another minute.
What about the others?
And that was the end of it?
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
That's not her.
No.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Lucky for them they didn't.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
Hand me the phone.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
You knew about me.
Do you have to point that?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
The money, Nels ... ?
Why are we stopping?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
There are no guarantees in this life.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I wish it had never been invented.
We don't see you.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
My pleasure --
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
There's two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Let her tell you.
Government business?
From here on, I dish it out.
So who's he?
Then why doesn't she?
How?
Did he?
What would you call it?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Persistent.
Stop it, Dil --
Who the fuck is he?
Charming.
Cunt.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off, Dave.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
She's not that either.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
No.
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
Must be.
No, I didn't --
How special?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Yes, please.
How different?
Didn't think I could.
I am.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
When?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
So they do know.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Only if you kiss me.
Not at all, honey.
Yes.
I'm not sure.
It's a secret.
I promise.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
You knew my Jody?
Don't you want to kill me?
Okay.
Let me go, Dil
I like you, DIl
Yes.
Yeah.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Thirty-five.
Leave me alone, Jude.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
Yes?
Some judge...
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Peter.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Can't.
So, what do I look like?
Am I?
No. It's the truth.
You want to bet?
Not in your nature.
No.
Tree.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
What do you believe in?
If they kill me --
I don't know her.
A story.
What does that mean?
No.
Why?
You won't run.
Tell me, Jody
What about it?
Adam --
Open up.
Let's look anyway.
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Look.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
I heard you, I heard you.
You mean spies and things like that?
May I have a sandwich, please?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
But no one actually saw him die.
The last one, please.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Brian.
Yes.
No.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Me?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see my passport?
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Okay.
I think I love you, Alex --
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
Who?
I'm sorry.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I dare you.
I don't believe it.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
You mean, you're a thief?
I don't believe it.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
How much is it worth?
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
Here's ten.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you want?
Stop it!
Swiss.
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
We won! We won!
Why, do you think we're going to?
Quitter.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Now you're angry.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Starting tonight?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
How would you like a spanking?
What?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Yes?
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Don't you want me to stay?
How can you tell?
The American Embassy.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
As fucking if.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's still a virgin.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
You're not?
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
No.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
This party is sick.
That's what he said.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
How could you?
I'm worried about someone.
No.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
What?
Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD!

It must've happened right after we left.

And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...is death.
 No...
Doctor.
...-son.
...tunnel!
I didn't sell the boy any...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
Just go check the temperature.

I'll lead 'em out.
You sure?
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Probably.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Who's the investigating officer?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
His girlfriend?
Maybe.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
She's fine.
Yes... I think I can manage...
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Where's that?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I don't know...
I said okay, Jake.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How are you, Lou?
How'd you get past the guards?
Who?
No.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
You accusing me of extortion?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
C'mon I'll show you.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Well yes.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
I was grateful.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
The Valley?
What? What is it?
Get in the car.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
What were you doing there?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
...A flaw...
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Aren't you coming back with me?
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Katherine.
She's my sister.
She's my sister and my daughter!
I'm all right.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
A Miss Sessions calling.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Si.
What about the water?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's not completely dry.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid so.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Yeah.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
No, you have a press agent do it.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
Why'd she run away?
So I can have these? 
But you don't have any kids!!!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
It tastes wonderful!
Too bad!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
What's she like? What's she like?...
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
For what?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No...
Somebody stole it.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
What does it say there?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
You know why?  She was so -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Charlie?!

Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
That's Leland, isn't it?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
What's the matter with you?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
In the water.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
I work at Seligman's.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Susan, I really think -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Charlie -
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
She was going to leave you anyway -
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Was he in love?
Yes.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Queer?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
How long have you been a smoker?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
Awww. That was so cute.
You two better quit it.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
No, you're not really getting married?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
I'm just kidding.
Who doesn't?
Um... okay.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
Oh God...
Just me.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Excuse me?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
So I'm told.
Lenin's Tomb.
Are you open?
Peptic ulcer.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Did you tell Veronica?
Oh, my God.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Yeah.
Basically.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
You've got a customer.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Gatorade.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
An embarrassing way to die.
How'd he die?
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah, but at what a price.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
If you must.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I know I'm your hero.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Living proof.
I don't; you did.
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Fuck you.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Same time. What about you?
I know I can bench more than that!
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Something wrong?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
You're a pig.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
No way!
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye. 
More bang for the buck.
So, what do you see?
It can't fly in this weather.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
I did what I thought was right.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Would you?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Nice and easy...
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
I don't expect you to understand.
You couldn't.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
From one professional to another, of course.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
He can handle it.
You got to go back now!
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Next time, date only basketball players.
What?
Jess, c'mon...
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
I won't do it.  No way.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Anyone else following?
There.  You blind?
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
There, what's that place?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you, sir.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Who are they, sir?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Well, how are you then?
Aye.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
No, brother. What d'you want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Vitamins will it be then?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
I haven't seen you before.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Prison custody?
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Travel...and things.
Bottega.
Just had one.
How often you go?
Sure thing.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
You're kidding me.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Of course.
Then let's have it.
I'm sorry.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Can you finish on schedule?
Twenty five?
Very generous.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Pick me up in five minutes.
This isn't our goddamn game!
No harm done, ma'am.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Who the hell is this?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
It's not that kind of job.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
With what?
Yeah.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
I'm trying...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
It's a mess.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Yeah.
What?
I don't understand...
I'm not catching a melody.
Leave me alone.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
What'd they do?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Answer the question.
Let her go.
Excuse me?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
What is?
For what?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Nothing is easy.
What is it with you and the space program?
Do they have a secret handshake?
I have no idea.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Getting rid of my hub!
Never, but I've been practicing.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Realized what?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
A water main broke.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Come on.
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
Without a love of my own.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
What about you?
Could you be a little more specific?
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
The truth shall make you free.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I don't understand.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Agent Lowry?
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Your call.  Have a good night.
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Actually I'm running late --
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
This is how you see the sky?
It's a civilian facility.
You want to classify prime numbers?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Many others.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Can you help us?
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
And?
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
You too.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
If you came back.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
Please --
-- I don't know --
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Meaning...
But --
We work down in the ditch?
I'll make it a dollar.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
She's got him! You hear that?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
I'll give you fifty cents.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
What for?
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A Lucas Jackson.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Cuter.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
No. No chains either.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Fear of what...
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Hal has it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
When was that?
You already made the delivery?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Nothing.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Then what do you need me for?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Let me get a little action started here.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Yes.  I have to go...
<u>What</u>?...
Is there a phone booth there?
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
What else?
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Classy madonna.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Look at him, grandstanding...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Right.
Good.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Because I think I'm wrong.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Thank you.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I'd have to see it on.
What about the engagement party?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Green spot.
I answered these questions last night.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Lie down.
Michael, I...
Home free.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
No, I need some serious household advice.
Open up.    I want to see.
Really?
You got wine. That's great.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
I got worried. Are you OK?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
And all the plans we have.
Letty, please.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Can you loan me a 20?
So, what do you say, Let?
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
He's a patient here.
I love him.
Here's the ring.
I heard about your friend.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
What does that mean?
I'll float you.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
What?   This?
It's me...
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're calling me on is phone?
What?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I assume you want something?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
How about if I call you?
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
No problem.
We can't.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Where are you from?
What about the money?
I can't believe you didn't check.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Man, I can get anything.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
How much?
You said don't do it, boss.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything?
Good song though.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What is it you do, Sami?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Yeah, I can see that.
It's my idea.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Mr. Taylor?

God, I want to go home.
The baseball is mine.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
What does arresting us get them?
Take a nap.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
A little?
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
What's it to you?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
What's it to you?
Let's go!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Don't bother.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
You're too young to understand.
Really?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
What do you think?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Come and get it if you can.
Then you have no use for the sword.
My comb!
You coward!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
Let them look.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
A murderer?
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
No further.  I'm serious.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I should be trying to stop you.
How 'bout the morgue?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
I dabble.  May I?
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I don't know you...
Another jolly nickname?
T-Bird?
I can see her.
Magic.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Annette Harrison.
You might say that.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You what?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
On my mother's life.
Junior.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
It's not really important.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
It's my house.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Who?
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
How was your date?
What are you doing?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
No.
Yes.
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
Hi.
I love you.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I don't think that bothered him.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
It was nothing.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Okay.
Well did you like it?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
That's one way of looking at it.
Just taking your photo.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I'm taking a shower.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
Yummy.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Who is this?
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Outstanding.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Okay.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
What's your plan of attack?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Morning.
So what went wrong?
Where'd she go?
Mock, mock, mock.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Will you calm down?
And if I don't?
I'll do my best.
That's beautiful.
I'll do that.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
What do you mean?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Yes, darling.
At the old house with the voice.
I got my wish anyway.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
Times have changed.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
But wishes don't come true.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
They ran away.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But there's no one here, darling.
Yes, darling.
You called me by my name.
For as long as you'll let me.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
The numbers simply don't mean anything
A princess?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
But she's dead!
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But she's such a nice lady.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Can we get some service here?
At Victoria's Secret.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
No it's mom.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
You're just saying that.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And my bra finally fits again.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
I still thought it was a purse.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I guess you'll find out.
Sure. See ya.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
On your desk.
No?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What's that supposed to mean?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
I told you she was innocent.
We only live a few blocks apart.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
And that was 28 days ago today.
The other one?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
He tried to kill me!
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Yes, sir.
Don't know much, do you?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Then we must call the police.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
I have to go...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this ?
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Yeah.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Fine.
What do you mean, he's clean?
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Choices?
Oh my gosh...
I'm not sure... I might have.
What?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Wrong...
She knows.
Perceptual?
Why?
Oh... Thanks.
What do you mean?
No.
What?
What about it?
No... They don't kid.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Anybody would have done it.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
What?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Ain't no place safe.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Will do.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Hey, this is great.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Knox, you gotta calm down.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
And English, and trig
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Oh come on, Pitts...
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I couldn't stop myself.
So much the better.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I'm sorry.  I, we
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
what?!
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
It does?  What?
The pleasure is mine.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Dead Poets honor.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Courtyard?
Don't stop!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
But different.
I'll take him over mine.
I... I just don't want to come.
I don't want to read.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
We have to make it to the third deck...
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
What the hell are you talking about?
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
I saved your life is what I did!
I don't know...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
You people...rich people...
Quite a few.
Anti social?
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
You should talk...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Right...
You ain't giving the orders here!
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
Me??
I'm stuck...
I don't know...you got what we need?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
I have been.
One whistle... Start the engine...
Joey...
She fucked me.
Those are mine!
Get the boots.
Fuckin' A!
John,we're going huntin'.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit.
Vince thinks... you know...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
I know! I fuckin' know!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Where is he???
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Here.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing.
Nick.
This is horrible!
Merle, I wanna go home!
Right here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
You got it.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Merle...
We what?
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
I gotta get back, Nick.
Yeah.
No.
Aw, it's a long story!
What's it for??
Up.
Kimberly!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Put that on your political resume.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Out of the room.
I'm not voting for you.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Where?
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Not the 'T' word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
But Sergeant...
How do you know?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
My insurance won't cover it.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
Drop it.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Thanks.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
...Have you been drinking?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Take a look at this.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
We will --
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Thank you, Belle --
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
That's just too bad --
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
No, Stone!
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
I do -- and I think you should too.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Well, I --
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Who is it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll never get my washing done.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
It shows on your face.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
You aren't angry with me?
I won't forget.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
The past six months.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
But meant her moving here.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
How about his job?
Ellis, what have you told them?
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Holly Gennero?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Roy?
How do you know?
Yessir.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Okay.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
It's okay... it's okay...
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
I'm really shakey.
Yeah... I know.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
You're crazy.
Where you gonna go?
Why you going to Algeria?
I know I am.  I know!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Right.  See you sometime.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I can't talk to him.
They're okay.
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Call me Sonny-boy.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
I frisk you?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
They were ...
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
We're bringing in your wife...
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
It's all we got.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Give me the keys...
I took too long.
Mulvaney...
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
I'll be God damned if you will.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
It was on the TV.
No, not until after they killed him.
My body?  What for?
Yes...
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
What kind of a deal?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
They're beautiful ...
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>
What?
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
What?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Take us to Vegas.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
Must you use that awful word?
I said stop it.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
I was a musician.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
There are no bond certificates.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Real fast.
I be.  I'm living large.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Have you noticed something about them?
Jade, I still love you.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
That's it?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Whew!
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Don't worry about it.
Can ya dig it?
It's a motherfucking shame.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Him no white.  Him no white.
I got no say over people.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Tonight, when we close.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Sal, I want my money.
Quit bullshitting.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
That's it?
Come in then.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I can't be staying long anyway.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
You're still late.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
HATE!
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You listening to me?
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yeah...
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Well la de da.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Cool.
You're it.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
You brave soldier.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
Go fish.
Sounds like a pirate.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
And he invented fire.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Our own special bus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
You can't marry my mom.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You have beautiful eyes.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
A blimp.
Am not.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I lugged it all over town!
Do you know what this means?
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
That's gross.
No.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
I'll talk to you later.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
He passed away three years ago.
Hey can be on top?
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
Will that be on the midterm?
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Wow, you are smart.
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Nothing.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Is this what you seek?
Paul!!  Paul!!
My Lord?
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
I'm ready.
Yes...
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
What is it?
Where?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
They tried and died....  Jessica!
What can be done has been done.
Stop him, Jessica!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
I predict we're lost.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Don't you bave a car?
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
The <u>women</u>?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I don't understand.
That's good.  I could use the money.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
I never said I could ad-lib...
So how'd we do?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
You mean a Tesla coil?
These shoes are itchy.
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I guessed.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh, just like in the script!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
But you used to say --
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Da pleasure be mine.
Tor!
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Oh.  My condolences.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
What do you mean?
No! I love sex with girls.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Yes?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
So how long have you known Eddie?
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
I'm directing.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Come on...
Went --
I'm moving out.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
You're nuts.
What?
Excuse me.
Cool.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
This guy.
Good luck.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!
Holy sh--
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Mom?
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Who's in it?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Right.
Well, when you put it that way.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Yeah, well...
The what?
Oh yeah.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
... yeah, then, but...
No. Who?
Ohh...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Come on, let's go.
The what?
Come on.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What do we have to do?
What are you drunk?
You're in show business?
We're excited.
What's the dif --
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
I know.
Ray, come an--
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
What...
Ed... I'm sorry.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
What kind of person?
Thank you.
Here, get down.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Yeah?
Hey, that's super
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
As far as I know, they--
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Why are you lecturing me?
That sounds good.
Yes?
Oh yeah, you bet.
I did it.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Should we get a what?
Dave.
Still clear?
Yeah.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
I'm not like you.
I don't care.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Don't you fucking knock?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You fuck for money.
That simple, huh?
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Let's just kill them.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Which one are you and which one am I?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I got her address.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Susan Lefferts.
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
Say what and so what.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Man, what're you saying?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
And?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Answer yes or no.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
And now you'll provide them.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Of his penis, sir?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
What's her name?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Why not?
You, me and White, huh?
I know how he feels.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
I just called it.
Something like that.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Who are you calling?!
Listen--
Told by whom?
The NSA?
Yeah.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I called my wife!
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
They come after you?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
<u>Here</u>?!
Why?
No he won't.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
How fast can you learn?
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Is that good?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Eight.  Size eight.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A report?
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
Yes sir.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
I see her for business.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Just reporters.
Stacy--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Oh.
Who's doing this?
Bullshit.
I <u>did</u> care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Yeah.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Seat 74.
Merry Christmas, son.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Mr. Dean--
Are those my Christmas presents?
Where's mom?
Do I know you?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
The blender?
They only took electrical appliances.
Bobby--
Calm down.
You're tired.
I have a family.
Are you still in Crystal City?
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Get it.
He had help.
Lyle?!
And if it wasn't?
Do you have visual?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Yes sir.
As the wife of one of our party.
I do not.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
That makes it harder still.
It's a folk song.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Shall we be all right?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
What?
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Her hands and feet were tied.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Ask him.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
For?
Oh really?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
Aren't you?
To arm-twisting.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Yes.  Dropping off.
Are you crazy?
Because I'm a nurse.
Yes?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
You'd better be.
Yes.  Later.
Of course.  When?
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
I don't think so.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Why didn't I think of that?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
It's sold.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
I'll call an ambulance.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
You...you can't.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
You can't.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Let's just see how we do.
It was a long time ago.
A dozen times.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Ready.
Duh.
Shut up.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Where the money is.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
We're doing it tonight.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Have really held you under?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Remind me why.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You know where my loyalties lie.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
The what?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Yup.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Where's Anna?
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So you think we got 'em scared?
What, you think I'm made of money?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
They skipped that step.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
What?  Who?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Not in my world.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
The extortion, the threats ...
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Right.
That's right.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
How come you're not eating?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I don't know.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
I do.
You got a little girl?
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
I'm gonna clean it up.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Keep your voice down.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
I need it.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Mm-hm.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You won't.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Yes.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Or you ran into something ....
I take it back.
What is it?
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You mean a man you can control.
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
A mining colony.
Can you trust him?
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Luke!
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
I thought you knew this person.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
What did you say?!
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I thought I was in good shape.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Never.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
They suggested oranges.
They're...pretending to dress.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You told me he was dead.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Don't lie to me.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
No.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
It's history. I gotta go.
Where'd they go?
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Sewers. Come on.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
So be it, to the death.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
But not from your destiny.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
So be it.
Well hurry then, and get it.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Not you, my husband?
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
No.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Just show the sword.
I didn't know that.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Oh great, anything else?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
No kidding.
Burke.
Storage.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Not that I know of.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Please.
You're a nice man.
Karl!!
She is going to be well?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Fine thank you.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Convulsion?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
That depends.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
I beg your pardon?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
No.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Um........Stuff.
When can I have one?
Captain Howdy.
Here I'll show you.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
Why does God let us get tired?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Damien Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
So what's wrong with her?
So what's next?
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
I came to say goodbye.
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
La plume de ma tante.
Who are you?
No momma.
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
Defender of the human race...
She'll go into coma.
Don't listen.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Come on!
Bastards! Stop!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Twelve.
I don't know.
Why not?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You're not going to drive.
Little slow tonight.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
They're falling out.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
How's the birthday girl?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Two nights.
My pleasure.
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Fuck him.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
It's me.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
Let's get it over with.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
Here, how's this?
Right.
You recognized me.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Two years ago.  March.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Yeah.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Two hours ago!
No. Why?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
The tenth's out.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
I don't know.
Seventy-one
Shut up, Frank.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
All right.
Well, that's fine --
Right.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Don't take it personally.
Impersonally.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Where's my name?
Time for what?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I said I was sorry.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
What?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Yeah.
For a while.  She left.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Every year.
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Better than that.
I'm not upset.
How do you know?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
He called her.
Coffee?
Huh?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
No.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
He hit a guard.
Yeah -- me.
My place.
How old is he?
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Only one you've never broken.
It's important.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
What?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
No problem.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Have fun at work.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
-- Studying.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Back then -- who wasn't?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
You?  Married?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I’m sure you do...
What about me?
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Sure.
Great room...
I don’t think so.
It’s me, Jack...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
C’mon, Jack...
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Uh huh...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
For us, Kate.
You hear me complaining about that?
Because that’s where I live.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
And...?
Really.
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
Zeena...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
And now...?
But you always seem so certain.
That’s a big one for me, too.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I’ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I’m out of the doghouse?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Are you okay, Jack?
Promise me again...
It’s good to see you...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Hey, are you okay?
I'd like that, too.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Youthful high spirits.
He's made a few changes.
<u>Should</u>?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben.  Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
And you can?  Power it up?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Not this again --
Johnny.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Hilarious.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Medical's ready.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
I'd hold that off awhile.
Brain injury.
Here's the Surgeon.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
And take a little trip with them...
Yes?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
Yes, Cora.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Now I know...
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Nothing -- against all that force.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
What about Dr. Michaels?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Send the following message...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Where we going?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Uh -- what?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Jezhush.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Personal matters.
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Oh, yah, I know that!
Where'd you get him that parka?
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah?
Oh, man!
Hold on.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
No. No, ma'am.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir? Right now?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Good day, sir.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
...Who they playin'?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
The heck d'ya mean?
Mm.
Call 'em up.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Just a Diet Coke.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
What'd he say?
No.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Love ya, Margie.
Yah?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yah, ya think?
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Congratulations, Jerry.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
We're still men.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really, what's that?
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Yes?
No, I wasn't aware...
Dynamite?
This is... really a shock...
I'd like to thank the academy...
Can't you give me something?
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
I'll expose you.
I suppose.
What... ?
It suits you.
Good.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Whatever.
Do you care?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
Answer the question!
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
I'm sorry, but I...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Don't ask.
Yes... it's a test.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
There's always that.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
What fight?
Anyone?
My dad.  No question.
Any historical figure.
Yeah, I'm sure.
A liposuction clinic.
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
You know what I mean.
I want to know --
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
... is over.
Why do people think I'm you?
Answer me, Tyler.
I don't know!  Tell me!
What... ?
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What about Marla?
I can't let you...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Green?  Did you say green?
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What?
Not exactly according to plan.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why what?
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
You told me you'd say that.
Well, sir, you said you might.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No, please, no, God, no!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I...I...
You were there?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Random, sure.
That lucky bastard.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Yeah, you should have specified.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
What was the fight about?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
I'm not following you --
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
No, I'm good.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I...I don't know.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
He's not a witch.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Thirty-nine.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
I don't.
Why do you think I was hiding?
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
That's a plan.
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Star Wars?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
Where's your stuff?
No cigarettes.
Yeah...
I need a vacation.
American?
Let me see.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Yes.
How much we got left in that minigun?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
I thought he was with you.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
You think you are... .
I couldn't get you in.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
I know.
There were treating me like a headcase.
I say we tape him to a chair.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
You threw him out?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
Do I look like I have someone special?
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
And who's Lydia?
He just needs some clothes?
Thank you very much.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
No, it's not... Come here...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
You can ask.
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
They work for Him.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Fifty dollars?
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
So what? You going to help me?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
It's a classic.
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
You won't be alone for long.
No just Parry.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
I leave it to you.
Twinky?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
You said.
Yes.
I hope they do.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay...
I don't know.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Are you talking to us?
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
You know who it once belonged to?
Everybody still up on the Island?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Wait...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
What?
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
Bye, Robert.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Tomorrow, then.
I think it's what you think.
Shut up...
Yeah, I think I could.
Just give me a chance, will you?
What?
Is she?
At game, Carl.
You're all full of shit!
No, it's okay.
It's a Borzoi.
It is true.
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
That's an old maid's tale.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Hold onto this.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I, umm, came to see you.
I just wanted to see you.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I buy them flowers.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I got punished, man.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
A girl named Amanda.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
What?
Wha'?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
You're kidding.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Sonofabitch.
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
They didn't do anything.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
It was planted on me, sir.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
Can I ask anybody now?
Not a prayer.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Affirmative.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Where am I?
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
I'd have been long gone.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Where are you going?
What are you doing here?
No problem.
What's that?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Yeah.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
John Ultrarelamensky.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Please.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
You are a rich woman.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Why did you do it?
That's what I want to know.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I think you better sit down.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Come here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
What?
Moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
What...
Of course.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
But I am...
Thanks, I needed that.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
How much?
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Why are all these people after me?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
And hey, I appreciate it...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
I'm off it!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Julian, you're fired.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's yours too!
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Il fallait le faire.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Willie Mays.
Where the hell is it?
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
We put him to bed for the night.
Four.
Hiya, Jesus.
Darling, may I have this one?
Why is it called Hellgate?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Don't know what's behind it.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
He ain't the only one.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
I think you know, Frank.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
What'd you just say?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What?
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What if it's not...
I never knew you, Dad.
It did, Pop.  It did.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
You there?
H-hi.
What?
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Yeah.  That's it.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You work too hard, John.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Cool it, Andy.
Where's Shelly?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
Your bed.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Somebody was in here.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Great.  Just great.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I wish it was.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Sheriff, you better take this.
I could swear I heard...
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Okay.  There's one.
Did you hear me?!
Are they grown-ups?
But what I get scared again?
Yeah, we're here.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
There's no time for this bullshit...
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Yes.
The what?
It's going.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
I'm now begging you.
Have a good night.
Yeah...
Okay.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
-- Bad?!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Never.
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
Hear what?
No.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
Oh dear God...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Walking corpses are not real!
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Yeah...a lot.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
We changed our minds.
Just radio for help, okay???
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Where you're going, mister?
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
You are going where?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
It's over, finished and done with.
Asbestos lining.
What do I exude?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Do we care?
I say we go.
Here we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
What are you talking about?
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
I talked to her two days ago.
Can he get through it?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Everything.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Daddy, wait.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
I'd forgotten that.
It violates so many trusts.
I don't know if I can say that.
Washed away.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
Show him who we are.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Oh yeah?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
A little drastic maybe?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Everyone takes his turn.
All the more reason.
Eleven.
One more.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
A -- a week.
I thought you were against fighting.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
You will respect the law.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Even as a boy I thought so.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
That's when you take advantage.
There is nothing I can give.
It's split the Government.
Very well.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Who's leading them?
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Have you found him?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's over.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Grudges?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Thank you, no.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
They found my eyelash.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Antonio, the choir...
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
How tall are you?
You worried about the cost?
I've found him too.
Yes.
What exactly is wrong?
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Stay clean.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
It looks fine.
Fatter... some things never change.
No. It's been a long time.
It's all right.
Suit yourself.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
For exits off Main Street.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Do it my way.
You bastard...
I can handle it.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Why, there's nothing on the news?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Not now.
I think so... I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
You and me.
I'll be ready.
What's wrong?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
We walk.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Where?
What about the vault?
I'm good at that.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
You serious?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
When did you find out?
And you told Brumby?
Was the steering faulty?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Yes.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Nicer than most.
Once a week?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
Yes, I do.
Oh, do you?
No.
Really?
Was he?
Especially when I play the lead.
Yes.
At me friend's house.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Yeah.
How'd you find me?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Pension him off.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that supposed to mean?
Yes, thank you.
It would be. If they were still living.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
That's right.
...they hold on to their money...
I...I don't know.
What?
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh...?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
Huh.
No.
That's what I...
They...
What? 
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
Not actually, no.
We are?
Did you talk to Graff?
For five thousand?
He would take you on.  Yes.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Yes.
What does that mean?
No.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Is that what I just said?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
How ya doing?
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
What?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
We had a robbery. 
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Go to lunch, George.
Excuse me, sir...
...did they...
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Get in the goddamn room.
...do you want to go downtown...?
It isn't me...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Let me...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
You know what those leads cost?
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Twenty percent.
Good.  Now we're talking.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
What does that fucking mean?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
What?
Well, hadn't it?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
I...
Uh-huh?
What sales?
I'm sorry.
Because I don't like you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
That's right.
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Mmm.
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Home cooking...
Oh!  For the magazine...
Go ahead.
No, his wife is.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Mm.
What do I...?
Gimlet.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
To change our minds.
Tuesday.
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
I...
She told me not to talk to you.
And the check is...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm going home.
Did they...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
To do business.
Some day you will.
That's right.
Oh yes, the very best.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Michael...
No.
The children can stay.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Not for strangers; for my country.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Let's go.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
What's that?
What is it?  Can I help?
He's an Italian?
I'm going to see my parents.
I don't know.
I can't let him down.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Mike, at three and a half...
I don't know.
I know he's in Israel.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The room has a bug in it.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
I don't think that's necessary.
Very well.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Sleeping inside me.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
You haven't heard me.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Who's asking?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
How is his health?
Let him gamble.
No.
I deny his every charge.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You were unfair with them.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Keep them alive.
The same assurance we got from you.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
It never crossed your mind?
I didn't mean to...
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Your wife?
Why?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Just that I was in the Marines.
What was wrong?
Broke is more like it.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
It's new.
Your family ate dripping?
What?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
All right, I guess.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Do you miss it?
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I didn't --
I'm game.  Sure.
Clayton is fine.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
I see.
What happened?
Not at all.
I don't remember that one.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What'd you say?
What was that?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Fuck off!
I think I'll hang around.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes.  Perfectly.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Yes?
Go.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Quite.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Head.  Not heart.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Tell me about Kip -
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I knew you'd say that.
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
What for?
Kip.
You know my back.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Something like that -
I don't think so, Detective ...
Cadillac.
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Good.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Donny-nothin'!
one minute -- !
We don't -- ?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Mother -- !
You remember that, Kip?
Oh, for God's sake
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
I dunno ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah -
What do you got ... ?
What?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Nah.
What?
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
What for -- ?
Now, we go -
Where we going -- ?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Mitch.
On account of me.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
Very good...
No ...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Wrong preposition...
What about The Club ... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I dunno. I know a place.
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
And the moral of that story is -- ?
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
I'll see you soon --
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No more shines, Billy.
What?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods again.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
I'm in construction.
What bag?
Jezuz Christ!
It'll be okay.
Just get me out.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What?
There are cops all over the place.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Nah.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Yeah.
Will you stop.
He heard.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
Yeah.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
--or a tail--
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
She went to Medical school in California.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
You don't know that.
Ah, history I think.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
I wanted to meet your brothers...
How you doin'?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Retainer...
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
It's touching me.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What're you doing?
That's right.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
--Half-red, half-black--
An integer.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Yes.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
Never been.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Sounds good.
What's the point?
Like what, Will?
I did.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Nautilus?
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You've never been on a plane.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Hence, the word remarried.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Not to me, they're not.
You're not going to fail me are you?
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
You're Welcome, Will.
Good luck.
What?
I'm Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
So you just want to use me and go?
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
You know, nothing special.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Do you know all their names?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
And you're sure about that?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
I'm not honest?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Goodbye.
Joe!
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Gallon or two?
She got to make it.
Sure, but what is this?
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Which way is House 25?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Goodnight.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never heard nothin' about it.
What you figger to do?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Naw--not much!
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Ya say we're acrost?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
You promised, Tommy.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Won't they come out here?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
I wisht it was day.
Whatsa matter?
I never--
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
What?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Yes.
Okay.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
You see someone?
Yep.
What's that?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Yes.
It's something I do...
That's probably a good idea.
Come on.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
No.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
No harm no foul.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Nope.
In Portugal, yes.
--Nooo--
It was the PLO.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Yup.
This?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
You sleeping all right in that house?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Five years. My son was born here.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Huh?
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
No, you just act like you do.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Well, one was for salad...
You're right. Good.
About what?
Tom?
Go ahead...
Hi.
I should be in by two.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Why?!
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Everything all right.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Let's not talk about that now.
Take your time.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
She calls him Tommy...
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
That's what some folks say.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
He thought it was a ghost.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Sure.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I just could never say it!
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
Maybe... look -- just...
I want to see Pilgrim.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Sometimes.
Now that's cool.
Hack the Planet!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Shh!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
I'm gonna hit you!
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
What's going on?
Razor and Blade.
Burn!
Fucked if I care, man.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Uh, hold on...
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Yeah.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
I think we've got something.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We caught 'em.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
What, it left a note?
So?
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
555-4202.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
I don't know Brady.
We've been better.
Brady!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I can see this is useless.
How many bodies did you find?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I can't sleep.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Yeah, hurry up.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
I can't.
Dad, what's going on?
Why?
Don't you mean what you do best?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Right here, Ben.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Huh?
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
After the movie.
Tommy, let me in!
Was it the bogyman?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Only minimum security.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
I can't believe it!
Yeah.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Right.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
We're actresses.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Yes.
Yes.
Really?!
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Hi.
Bye.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Why?
I almost didn't.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you angry with me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Mom, come out!
No, nothing.
Mmm...
Mm-hm.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
Yeah?
I think they're fantastic.
Why?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
How are you?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Yeah.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Oh!
Wow!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Will you just tell me one thing?
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
It's, uh, you never know--
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Oh?
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
You got it.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Really?
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, who cares?
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
April?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...you don't have to think.
Some museum director disappeared.
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I hereby acknowledge that...
Or, perhaps...
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Say it in English.
Rich, comic book freaks.
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.

I'm not.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...

All Quiet Along the Potomac...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Impossible.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Not with any certainty we...

...what'm I looking at...?

And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think its meaning is clear.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Said what?
A wonderful country...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
I have had the honor. 
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
I don't <u>think</u> so.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
I don't understand.
I..
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
...yes...?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.

Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

Yeah, I just got back.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Give me the clipboard.
Uh-huh.
I don't really like your friends either.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But my name's not...
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
Well now there's a compliment.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
It's November.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
That's not what I mean...
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Unprofessional.
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
How are they with kids?
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Well, it's for a woman.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
No, no, no, no.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
Holly -- that's not so.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Damn.
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Philip!  The senior partner?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Shut up.
No.
No.
Even cosier.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I hear you.
If it came down to it what would you do?
How long is the voyage?
Me?  Of course.
She's the King's cousin.
It's done.
No -- I will.
You'll no see me again.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
Are you a cop?
What do you want?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
I'll be fine.
Who was that man last night?
I'm interested in mythology.
I know.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Not unless they're immortal.
He will not stop until it is over.
Get out.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
What?  How?
What's that next to him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
I know, Paul.
It's not for me to decide.
I'll no forget you.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I think he's dead!
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You won't die if you let me help.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Like what?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Okay.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Dennis.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
Give me an ETA.
What hospital?
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What I want is to help my father.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
I know the one.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Not until the man calls.
In my room.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Who is it?
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I guess we do.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Cockroaches?
I'll be back.
Let me see your identity card.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
I don't have that much.
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The police are very busy.
You said you had no whiskey.
Get in.
Today.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Oh my God!
When will they be here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Why sir?
He will be here.
Move? Where to?
Pack the bags, we have to move.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Homework?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
Yes.
What?
Why?
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
How dead?
The lieutenant wants the register.
Thank you, sir.
When?
The staff, the guests.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
And what's Steven's status?
So what stopped her?
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
-- fuck you!
Yeah, me too.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Did it work?
Left, goddamnit!
Most fun I've had all day.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
He's gotta still be down here.
We're safe?
I don't do groups.
So where's the party?
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
And then what happens?
I can't remember at the moment.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
What?
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
I never saw you --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
-- ten.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
What was her name?
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
I don't understand.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Go to your room!  Now!
Take me to her.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Don't be afraid!
Well, that all depends.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
I just, I don't know...
You didn't think much about that before.
Or what she was worth.
I don't know.  That's strange.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Were you fooling with the power?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
What about keeping an open mind?
Aubrey!
No...  NO!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
White meat will be fine...
Oh, that's nice...
What!
And you...are?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
Sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Who's that?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
No.  Really?
Unh-unh.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
It has already begun.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
I laughed, I cried.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why not just go now?
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
Last rites, sister?
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
I don't care.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Alchemy.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Too bad.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Why George, you big softie...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Tell me about it...
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Yeah.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
I myself --
Mind if I join you?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
...I'm sorry.
I know that, Amy.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
You don't say.
Every year?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Norville!
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Watch it, Archer --
He grins wolfishly.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
This I know, Benny.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
But, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Well, why don't ya read it.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
You --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
The mark notices.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
She's damn good, Lou.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
I've never heard of a cure.
Yes.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Is she a doctor?
I like her already.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
I am not a frightened girl.
I'm sorry...
And charming?
Good morning.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Why did you come in here?
I imagined this so differently...
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
Got a meeting uptown.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
And as usual no one believed me...
I wasn't star--
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
All right.
Good.
Stay out of trouble.
Birth control.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
What?
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
C'mon.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
But what?
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
A key party?
With Mikey?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Yes.
Forget how to ride a bike.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Out.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Huh?
Greetings, Charles.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
One more shot?
Huh?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
What's that, then?
I had him!
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Yeah.  All over.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Then change it.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Worth pursuing?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
How do you mean?
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Habit.
That's not what he thinks.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
After that she left the party to go to him.
Best friend?
Thought you wanted something fun...
You don't know.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Ah! You have questions?
Then God does not exist...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Yes... My God...
No.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
He jests.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
It is! Take the back stairwell -
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
And no one knows but us...
Be still!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
How do you mean, start?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
But how do you know?
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Are you mad????
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Yes.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
He did it to make you stay with him!
How could I not? She had to know.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What the hell would you call this?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
No.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Just kidding.
I've got to see.
Come on, you can make it.
No, you're not.
I told you.
I'm fine.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
I'm okay.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Did you get help?
I'll talk real slow.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Rio, baby!
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Hey --
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How's Julie?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
So why are you still here?
And do what with it?
What is up with that weirdo?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Drunk again?
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
What an odd question!
My last name is Pherides.
How do you know what my father thought - -
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
But that should make you like her.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
How did she die?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
It is for that he hates me.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Who?
All right –– all right.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
No.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Zuzu's petals.
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
The Building and what?
Thanks.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Mother . . .
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
No.
Yes –– charge.
No. No.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Have a good time, son.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Hello, Violet.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Right down here.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Neither am I.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
I'm going to scream!
Have you made up your mind?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Do you like it?
Would you rather leave?
Thanks for dropping around.
To keep from being an old maid.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Sure, sure I am.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
What the hell.  For you....
With butter, if they got any....
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I hope that's the cousin.
Yeah.
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
You're betting what you already got.
Over here!
It's still there!
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
What camera?
If there is, develop it!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Got it.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
Did you get any pictures?
Too late, it's written.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
You don't make enough.
The Shark's mouth.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Can't you tell?
Fooling around?
Door's locked.
Better yet.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
That's great.
What'd I say?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
It's still a good idea.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What?
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Shouldn't he be at home?
Waiting for Andy.
Great.
Nope.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
3:30.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Shut up.
What's that mean?
Double nope!
Just like this.
I'm going.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Maybe.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
What the hell is he doing?
He thought he had a good reason.
I can get it.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
What's that?
Sure.  Let's go.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
No, no.  That won't do.
No!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
We're taking that shark alive!
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Not good enough.
How you doing, Kelly?
... Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Depends on big brother.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Why you sonuvabitch...
I don't know, what else is there?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Now what?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
What the hell's there?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Don't hurry back.
That bugger moves fast.
That's what grandmas are for.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, I did.
No way....
It sure is....
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need milk....
We need beer....
Because....
No....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I'm not on vacation....
I like it.  Really....
You caught me....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
You have something to say about everything....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
You check it....
I won't....
Thank you....
I'm still five....
I didn't.
Thanks for the consultation....
Good night, Daddy....
I'll miss you....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Good.
No.
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
I always listen to my feelings....
No one does till they learn....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
Nothing....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
You're not going to bet it all....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
You're the man who drives the plane.
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Still chasing fish?
Oh, boy....
Will you leave me alone...?
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
I made them, man....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
When we got the grant....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
As long as he's been here....
Hoagie.
I am...You must know something about him....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Just trying to be helpful....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Screw you, Jake....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Yes.
Oh no--
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
You heard. Look for the knife.
Not too good in daylight ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
You don't really believe this?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Hey ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
And did they?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Wrong cabinet.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
My hands?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
You should. It's wonderful.
Do you pray?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh, tell the story.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
We will be fine!
Happy. He said "happy?"
Oh good.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Good night.
Easy, easy --
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Of course I know --
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
We decided to stay with you.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Said who?  Sugar?
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Call me tomorrow.
You.
No, I'm saying to be --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Rod, get on the camel.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
We still having dinner in L.A.?
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Well.  Good luck with that --
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Not a chance.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
-- and I'll get 'em.
I'm not your brother!
Can you be quiet?
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
What's a bad idea?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
So do you.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Nothing.
Eric...
That one time was just the bumper.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
You couldn't have made that jump.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
I would completely support that.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
You think they could talk to each other?
In Costa Rica?
But then you never get to go in space.
Something must've scared them.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
No. I couldn't see.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
It certainly does.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
John . . .
-- my --
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
I want to see the nesting ground!
I don't even know this woman.
Where does it say that?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
To collect my fee.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
But why?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?
You think this is all a joke?
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Can the kid walk?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
You're sure we have to?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Shhhhh!
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Six weeks?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
They died together?
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
The - - agility.  You're right!
Say again?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
I know.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Stick to my heels.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Like hell it is!
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Hola, bienvenido
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Thank you.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
Try to!
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
Why?
Machines hate you?
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
Who?
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Please!
John, John.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Yeah?
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Who is this? What's going on?
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
He... he's here...
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
That's my job.
Fuck you.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Video store?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He's fucking nuts.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
Not yet.
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
And if he's not?
In a manner of speaking.
No, I left it in his office.
I'll commit that to memory.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I do.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I suspected that he -- well.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He was murdered.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Why were you given notice?
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight -- and seven months.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
Then why haven't I been --
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
And we're upset too.
Ludwig?
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
Amerika for us!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
I photographed it extensively, father.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
That's your monkey, Denham.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
What?
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
No.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
-- Yes.
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Mm.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
What about everything since?
How would I remember?
No thanks.
I go on rounds.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You said you wanted these.
I don't see anything, do you?
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Mm.
You're going back?
I am.
OK.
Can you use these?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Yes sir, we know he --
Yes?
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
You got a letter from mom.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Uh huh...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's okay.
I hate it.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Uh huh?
Yep.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Who will read me my stories?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.
I do not, your honor, however--
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Eight, almost nine years.
Yes...
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Yes.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Sure.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Six.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
It's going to cost.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
How the hell are you going to do that?
No, but--
Ted, don't be so hostile.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Got it.
I'm sure.
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Any day.
No cried?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Can I free the prisoners?
Are you, General?
And we will begin with tearing it down.
General Chiang.
Thank you. Please sit.
Soon.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
All?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes.
I accept it. What is suffering?
Roughly five thousand men.
I do not know, Holiness.
When it is time.
Look here!
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Britain?
And, America?
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Where is that?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Thank you.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Is that true or pretend?
The Chinese.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I need to see his habitat.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
Mr. Cyr!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
You're crawling around like a--
I coulda shot you, you--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
We both know what they'll do.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Could we have intercourse?
They could try to tranq him on land.
Never been to Maine before?
So I don't like tents, why--
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I beg your pardon?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Night.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
I heard something.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
You wouldn't?
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
Good thinking.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Did he say anything?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
You threw it at me!!
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<u>Apologize</u>?
He said he knew Karate!
Kevin, hey.
Me too.
A jerk.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Wild guess.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Backstabber?
Why not?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Yes.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Yes...! They were screaming.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
We leave in the morning?!
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Let us go, miss.
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
No. I will find you.
There was none!
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
We were headed...
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
That is sedition! Treason!
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
That's all, sir.
By your leave, sir.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Gifts?
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
France.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Shit...
How do you know it was Williams?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
It...almost got you.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
He's tanking on us...
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Under there?
What are you going to do to him?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Let's hope it holds.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Your pocket?
Well, it's still a good idea.
Seven hundred for the pair.
Well, talk.
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
No Harry, you can't.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
How about you? All right?
What the fuck is going on?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
What do you mean, me?
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
How the fuck should I know?
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
I can't take any more school.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
I-I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
You're testing me?
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That's in Maverick County.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
He never asked her.
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
They fought against the Indians?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Cool.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
You know who it was they dug up?
Substance abuse?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Protection?
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
He was a unique individual.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
Seems like we have another one every week.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Right.
You go by your old house?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Do you?
Buddy Deeds--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
The Perdido thing?
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
He was killed.
I was too busy.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
That's me.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
He's going to wish he was dead.
And that was the last time you saw him?
What was your deal with him?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
What do you think?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Pilar--
Nothing.
I came back 'cause you were here.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
I been working on a few things.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Another woman?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
I told you --
He's a priest?
What about death?
It was me.
Why did you wait so long?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
And you don't ask questions?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
Do you?
They won't tell you anything.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
I wasn't.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
--vanished.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I heard he was the best.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Mine.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
What?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
I don't know what else to do.
And you're not?
Yes?
I don't know.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
No!
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
No.
Ok.
No, you smiled.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Ok, whatever you want.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, yes, it does...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
Because that would be too easy.
Fuck off.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
No, we'll find something around here.
That's what you said the other night.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Yes.
Thanks.
Yes?
Oh?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Good-night.
Bob?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Tomorrow.
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
What happened?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
How many weeks are you honey/
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
What's the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Maybe that's my problem.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What are these?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
What did he say to you in French?
Not a lot.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
Whish the circumstances were different.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
It's Detective Smythe.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
How're you doin' today?
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
I can't eat before a game.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Don't curse.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's ridiculous.
The blue.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
This time get your feet set.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Yes, we appreciate that.
What?
Oh, great.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
She hates all freshmen.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just wanted to say good game.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's up, Sidra.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I just can.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
I don't.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Figures.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What?
I know, right?
What?
Plan to.
Right here.
You're not stupid.
Nobody.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Not really.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Yup.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Find.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
For what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
What's that, not great?
We still have to go?
We were just studying.
Sorry.  You okay?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
What?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Brain and Lung.
It's a helluva disease.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
baby, please, please --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
You won't.  You won't have to.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You don't know how crazy I am.
I've got troubles.
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
Cynthia?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
Son, please, now....
Sorry, little man.
No.
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
What?
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Mmm.Hmm.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Yes.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Do you wanna sit down?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Is Jack your son?
Like I said, yeah --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
And that's what you've heard?
Hollywood, mainly.
She's retired.
people die.
From '84 to '89.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Is Linda here?
About three weeks ago.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
Calm down.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Ok. What's your name?
What's this, how did this happen?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I didn't hear anything.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
Did your wife find out?
All your other fluzzies?
I got in trouble at school.
Are you alright?
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
I'm sorry, Stanley.
I'm a bad person.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Rose, I don't --
What about now?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Do you know the answer to this?
I don't know what I've done.
Are you her boyfriend?
It's alright.
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
You need to sober up.
What are you doing?
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
mmmhmm.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
That's it.
Yes. What? Yes.
Thank you.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
We need more dog food --
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
I didn't know the answer --
It's ok.
....Why does he do it...?
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
M'lady...?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
I am with you!
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
But -- what is he doing?
You're a fool!
To the Bastille.  And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
You can't do it.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness?
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Well... Well... Okay.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
Who came?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Thank you, Keeper.
Eh?
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Sire, I --
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
So what?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Fine...
Right behind you.
What?
I'll live...
And what did he do to the girl?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
No...
No.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
I killed them.
OK...where do you want to start?
1490...Breckinridge...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
What's the bottom line?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
Christ!
Not the Bible?
Library of Congress.
Read it.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
You said the guy down here is good.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What's one way?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Wait, Will...
What's it narrow down to?
That's narrow?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What's that?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Don't talk to me!!
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
How far away's the back-up?
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
The Tooth...
No!
Yes.
Yes.
Please, no.
Yes.
God, no.
No.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Hi, Linda. ..
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
No. I can help you.
He only bit women so far, right?
What's average?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
And you said?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
I love you...
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
I want to see you, too.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
You going back down to Florida after?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Huh?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
You read about it, I'm sure.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
You had disadvantages.
No.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Pretty well.
No.  Caspiar.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
There'll be other shots.
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Yeah...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Okay.  You're probably right.
What is this, World War Two...?
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Are you sure?
Oh.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Er, yes.  Speaking.
So your name's not Gorsky.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
They're gonna lynch him!
What's your name?
Know what?
I know.  It's her fault.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
You killed them.
Sorry.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
I need an exit!  Fast!
I got you.
Shit!  Apoc?
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
... Yes.
No.
What does that mean?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
Wild, isn't it?
For what?
Show me.
You -- you're too fast.
Your mind makes it real.
What -- what lesson?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
She would say she knows enough.
Yes.
What do you believe in?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Good.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Yes, sir.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Honestly?  I don't know.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
Gee-zus.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
Are you worried?
... right as rain.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I'm going in after him.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Neo, this has to be done!
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Follow me.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
And say what?
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Wouldn't bother me.
Didn't show up.
I could have told you that.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
No.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
I know.
Chinese food?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
What do they expect you to say?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Anything specific?
Did you?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
I know...I know.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
I know...I know.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Well...no.
Quiet please.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
It's for the party, Dad --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Yes, it is.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
You mean this, sir?
Right away.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Am I not obligated to?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Thank you.
'Yes' to the deal?
No no, not you.
As close as a deal could be.
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
For how long?  And why?
Please, Drew.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
Certainly, Bill.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
'It's up to Joe'?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
Good morning, Jennifer.
It's so very nice to see you again.
But she loves you?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
To bed.
-- I guess you haven't.
I loved it.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Don't.  That will come later.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
'Threw' you?  Where?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Yes?
Yes.
I don't understand.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Well, they're mine now.
Does she know where she's going?
I don't expect you to.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
That's life.  What can I tell you?
You should hope quite a while.
Of course.
I don't!
I think you know --
I want to have a look around before I take you.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
You think Drew will go for it?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Hi, honey.
You're only six-five once.
I am.  With you.
So what's wrong with that?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
Yer damn right.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
It's something.
Joe?
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
I'm sorry --
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Did I say something wrong?
But we've got time.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
From what?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
As requested.
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
Yeah, I remember you.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
I don't want blood on them.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Did you?
There are things you know for sure.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Just relax.
What happened?
Who did he go to meet?
And what did he say?
Somebody's come. Already.
Don't protect him.
Help me.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Why not?
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
What are you here for?
Did Teddy send you?
So why did you come here?
It's good.
I enjoy it.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
You know it?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Probably left it in your room.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Why?
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.

Doing...?
Turn around.
He any good?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Good.
Tell them what you want.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Died in childbirth, having me...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Exactly.
What do you mean?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Twenty-eight-point-five.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
When?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
And what do I do with him?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What kind of weight?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Nothing.
Five minutes...
Verdado.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Then you should.
This is Agent James Fujima.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
To recruit you.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Where's Riccardo?
I don't understand...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
What's it say?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Meaning...?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Alonzo...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
I ain't sleepy.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Whatsa matter now?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Don't need a comb.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
What?
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Get down -- where?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Getchmis...?
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
The Hilton.
I know.
Oh Jesus! 
Sixty?
Stupid.
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Billy!  Please!
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah.
Cut his fucking throat.
You can't take anything seriously.
My passport!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
That's a great philosophy.
Mr. Yesil.
Who?
Shit.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
You the bug lady, right?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
What are they...?
Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
It's fine.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I know how that can be.
Yeah, thanks.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Annie, what's the matter?
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
...have to wait.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
You don't know?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
What is it?
He's your client, huh?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
You think he might be missing?
So do I...
Buster.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
That'd be a first.
All done, chief..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
What are you talking about?
More like two-two point two million.
..or hard wired..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
I'm not ready!
Exactly where is she?
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
So do I.  Sort of.
Of what?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
I'm fine..
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
She must still be on the property.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Do I?
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
So what do you suggest?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
May take a little time.
Who is "they?"
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
You didn't have to.........
We did what we had to do.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
One hour.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Certainly Ethan.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
What about Job?
Jack.
Just don't chew it.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
Youíre probably right.
I don't know.
Itís not working.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
And I'll have the special fish.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Thank you, Rose.
No. You were there.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
You did this once it didn't work out.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
I won't come.
He did?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Maybe I should come back another time.
I'm making you a steak.
Instantaneous.
Stupid.
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
Because I have no Luck!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Don't just become excited.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
She didn't like me.
Oh no I didn't!
I'll come to the wedding.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
For what?
I know what I know.
Why?
Is Johnny here?
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Never is a long time.
This is a good suit.
How about a month from today?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
How was your plane ride?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
If I marry you my mother will die.
I must ask for that back.
Where's the ring?
No.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
A wife knows.
Everything's different.
It was a miracle.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Did you see it?
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Sure!
I am alone in the world.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I think it's because they fear death.
No.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
Sure.
Well. That explains it.
What? What?
Oh.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
Oh. Right.
I knew she had it.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
We don't have a lord.
You don't vote for kings.
Who are they?
NI!   NI!
One that looks nice.
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
'Tis but a scratch.
Had enough ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Greetings King Arthur.
Quite.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
... Well, we did do the nose.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I can't take him.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
I was saved at the last minute.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, I'm not.
Ector.
They're doctors?
Please ... we are doctors.
You got my note!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Seventy a year.
The good-looking one.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Yeah.
Of course.
A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.
Quite.
She's busy.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
It is quite late enough.
Aye, do.
I beg your pardon?
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
I don't think about it.
I'm fine.
This is the top.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I do what I do.
See what?
She's well, too.
Who by?
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
To keep out the cold.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Then why send me back to them?!
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Yes.
So?
You can't know that for sure.
Who?
Excellent!
Whom?
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Just them?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Of course, at once.
Again?
I have no idea.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
He?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
It's twelve-thirty!
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Laurie's.
We can't...
What?
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One.  In case...
What?!  There's nothing here!
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Not yet, honey...
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Sign me up.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
What did you say?
No.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Yeah.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Before what?
But it said #12.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
Oh...
Mulholland Drive?
Not that I can see.
Maybe it's not me.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
This Denny's.
Go ahead.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
No time. Get him up.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
We drown.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I don't help criminals.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Ow...
Knock yourself out.
What ? Are you my mother ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
I just want to double check the facts.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Fire the whole division.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Thank you, sir.
Son, let's watch the tape.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
What did you hear ?
What ?????
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
What happened ?
Yes.
Thanks.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What ?
Zach from work ?
I'm fine.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
We made it !
Who was that guy anyway ?
No.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Ohhhhh.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
What boy likes you?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
She just had a baby that's all.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
No.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
oh.
Come on in!
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
But I wanna write about her.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I never met my mother.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I won't.
MOM!
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Give it to me!
Big deal.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
For the mini-bike fund.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Committed.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Phil for God sake.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Is that a yes?
Bye Niece, Vada.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Yes, I do.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He is?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
All right, here.
No.
Yes they are.
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm sure she will.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
It's no big deal.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Did she ever see Vada?
Here?
Is there enough room?
It's only eight o'clock.
You can get the general idea...
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
You never cared before.
Why?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Hi, is Vada home?
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
Mostly love, and romance.
Hi.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I'm allergic to it.
They're just fun to read.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
It's my mother.
What?
What?
I am running faster!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Really?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, okay.
Kindred spirits.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
And you believe that.
The man you love.
Try less appropriate.
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
You need a few dollars.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
No.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Hello.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Don't you see...
... look good on Kimberly.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
W...
What's next?
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Have you.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Yes.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
That's little egotistical.
If you find her...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
You're much more his type.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Grand Old Opera --
I know that, Star.
I won first prize.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What?
You're so good.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
D.C.
Stop it!
When is it?
Bill, he's a crazy man.
To the bathroom.
What crook?
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Not yet.
What is a turkey shoot.
How in the world did he get shot?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Bye.
No, I don't.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
He's a member of our congregation.
Tom. You remember?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
That's unkind.
What...?  0h, yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Hundreds of times.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
He's pretty well known down here.
Sleeping.
Where is she?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Sure thing.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
That's what Tim said.
Yes, I would.
Yes, they were.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
What?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Whose ratings were higher?
She sings? What does she sing?
Then was it worth it?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Says who?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Out front.
No.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Yes.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
We are.  Your camera.
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
I do, too.
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They've hypnotized the nation.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Capt'n!
It's hard to say Capt'n.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
When do you want the assembly?
Okay.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
What are we talking about?
And me.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That's right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
What d'you think?
Okay, thanks very much.
Yeah. On the section gang.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
What d'you expect?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
I like a place with lots of life.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Take it easy.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
No.
I didn't know you had one.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Okay.
Plannin' on getting married?
I heard you.
She'll do.
Sorry.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Sure.
No, they won't.
Guess it's never been easy.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Anything you say, baby.
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Since when?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Of course.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
The Elders, mon...
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
I'd say you were full of shit.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
How are we doing?
We run. You crack the pattern?
How's the ice?
What's my end?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
Won't that mean you're dead?
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Give me five minutes.
I'll be okay.
What is it?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Yeah. Let's do that.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
College?
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Leave.
Nope.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
That is lingerie.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?

Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
Five-- Six--
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
But I don't want it straightened out.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Kristen got a quote?
They hid my car--
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
But I'm not a penguin.
See!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Better than I...
No. Josie, this is real.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Rufus?
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
When are you going to open your eyes?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Well, are you here with anybody?
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We went through the door...
Barrel.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He's dead, you bitch.
Yeah, why?
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Only the wet ones.
Shut up, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
It's happening again.
I don't know.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Oh, Jesse...
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Hi.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Hi, Kerry.
Thanks, Mom.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
They're healing up nicely.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
To old friends.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
So?
I don't do that shit.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Sounds like a rough time.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Your dreams?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Mary Helena.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Where...here?
Me too.
I'm not listening.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
No thanks.
No.
I forgot my bag.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
I thought you were leaving.
Oh no no -- no.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
How do you think I'm doing?
Thank you.  Shall I...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Yes.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Is that right?
The movie star?
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
What?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
It was good.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Still, not sparkling.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
The others?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Topol.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
No, it doesn't.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
No, no.  She doesn't.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Absolutely not.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
No -- you're right.
Why not?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Three.
What?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Go on...
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Thank you, ma'am.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Go ahead! Go back!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
No.
Ca-na-da...
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Me too...
Lemme see...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
No!
Can you borrow me a dime?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Hold it a minute.
A nickel.
He's not!
Hold it!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Shhh!  This way!
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
You's better believe it, brother!
Okay. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Hi.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I don't have any.
Take you han's offa me!
Evenin', ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Why?
No.
Your hair... is perfect.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
Yes.  We did.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
Except possibly that.
But, Faith--
Who's this?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
What?
So it wasn't real.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Hi.
You too.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
I know the feeling.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Yes.
Beautiful place...
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So?...
I know...  It was.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
I meant about my idea.
Packing.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
My God... you're right.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yup.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You miss me?...
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
In a minute.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Maybe.
I could have been better!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Good. So do I.
I am?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
I just told the Father.
Edie— it's—
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Are you sure they're your friends?
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Good luck.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I'm just resting my feet.
Sure... .
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Looking for me?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Hey look-
So-so, Johnny.
By way of Chicago?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Don't let them hear you.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
It would seem so, Master
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I will decide the conclusion.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
For what!?!
You mean...!
Is there time?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
You know better than that.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
What?!
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Really.  Hm.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
She's coming with us.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
Now you're talkin'.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I saw Karen Sisco.
You know how I felt about her.
Yeah, I did.
I don't know.
Whatta you wanna do?
I don't ski.
They sure do.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
It was an unusual experience.
And what happened to Carl?
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
The manager's door is metal.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
How are you, Raymond?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Wait, I know him --okay?
That's right.
Let's go outside and talk.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I thought everything.
Someone down here?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Really.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
What, as a sales rep?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It would be worth the risk.
She did, huh.
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I don't know...
Okay.  How many going out?
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
How are you, Richard?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Meaning time came, I left.
Hejira.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
What-- when?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Oh...
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Thanks.
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
It's a --
Oh, he's moved out?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
We don't get to talk much any more.
I'd like that.
What'd I say?
No?
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
You mean hiding them?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir, I --
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
You guys are new?
Power dive!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I was grieving too.
Fuck you.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Thank you, Sir.
Bombers.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Brilliant, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
Have the planes made it to China?
All of 'em.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Good—bye, Grandma.
Stag movies. Smokers.
How do you like my hair?
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Just what you underlined.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Aren't we a little old for that?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Don't say that...
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Great, isn't it?
Is this slow enough for you?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
That's real big of you.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Of course.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll just set it right here.
Oh, God, Dion.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
What, why?
I wish she hadn't.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
This morning was good.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
For what?
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I don't know.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Richard, take it easy.
Come on. You can't be serious.
What are you doing?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
It sucked.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Anywhere but here.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Go later...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Bob...
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
One hour!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Maybe you should think about it.
Maybe you should think about it.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
I have AIDS.
We?
As in, the vegetable?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What?
What's her name?
Thank you.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It's fine.
Uh huh...
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What have you prayed for?
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Gay movies.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Thank you.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes.
Is that a question?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
That's correct.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Not especially.
Who?
Duh...
That's perfectly clear.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Night, honey.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
Jesus.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Lookit. Lookit!
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Show me your eyes.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Like the light is scalding it.
Possibly.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey, who?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I assume he licked it clean.
Let's just be sure.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
60 years ago.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Riddick?
I would rather we all stay--
There is no "safe."
Which half?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Looks clear.
About the girl.
Just realized that, huh?
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
You still don't believe me, do you?
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
No.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
It's probably wrong --
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Him.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Sustained.
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Yes, I can do that.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
Why special?
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Mind your tongue, madame.
With one of them.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Okay.Up to the cave.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Yes.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Yes, Sir.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
Where?
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
How the hell did he get away?
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Says he can't walk.
Yeah, what is it?
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
What?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Who gives a shit!
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
You know what I'm talking about!
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
How far does this train go?
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Immigration Officer?
Bank?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Much too late.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
I don't.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
Nothing matters.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
They'll look for you.
Do you have to leave the note?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You understand perfectly.
There isn't anything you can do.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
I know that.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
This way.
You asked for it.
Why not here?
Martini.
Sometimes.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
What's a buzzer?
I've got good ears.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Yes, I've seen it before.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Would that make me a heel?
Doesn't answer the question.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I don't think you locked your door.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
That's not enough.
He saw my face too.
Let me know when you've identified him
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
So it seems Sergeant.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Should be over there.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Pretty big chance, huh?
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Positive?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Aye.  You have a point there.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Why should I mind?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
That's not very kind.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
He was delightful.
Yes.
Thanks.
Yes.
Very good.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Exactly that.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Freshman and sophomores...
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Who?
That'll be fun
To the airlift.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Come on.  Hand over.
Let me see.
Mmm...
Hello.
All right.
What about the Cromwells?
Take a look at these.
I'm not here.
Dad.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
She said that?
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You do it... you first!
You first!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Fine.
A little mushy.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
That's the point, isn't it?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Thanks, buddy.
Okay, Dad.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They took a left at the next light!
Figured you did.
I need you to teach me.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What are you talking about?
Warm them up.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
What, Sergeant?
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
The best friend I ever had.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Hawkins?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Who indeed...
How?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sit... and spin.
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Mmm, I could tell.
"Occupational hazard".
What are assets?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
All right, two thousand.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You're forgiven.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
He's good at what he does.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
You won't.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
I'm here.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
Why?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
And who is that?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Professionally?
Me?
I don't think it would fit you.
'Scume me.
I think it's great.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
With pride. What can I do for you?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
And what am I?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Anybody want a peanut?
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
What do I do?
He's really very short on charm.
Yes, some of the time. 
How many could you handle?
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
I'll be right back.
I don't be-leeve this.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
You want me to read this or not?
I don't understand.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Sire.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
I swear it will be done.
Of course.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
There we cannot help you.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I thought he was with you.
In that case --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
That would be inconceivable.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Oh, have it your way.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Morons.
You've made your decision then7
Have fun storming the castle.
A little bit.
"Keep a shining in...
Do the books!  Do the books!
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Mr. Bialystock ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
But what if the play was a hit?
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Aaaaaaaaaa!
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
No kidding?
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Bismark...
The Blue Max...
Where are you going vit the light?
What do you do best?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
No.
What?
How early?
Of which morning?
No one met her?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
And when she left, she never came back.
She isn't still here, is she?
Anyone at home?
If she paid you well?
Money.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Sam, if she's here...
What?
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
I don't need pills... just sleep.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Just what he told your detective.
I want to know if my sister is here.
With you.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Don't you know?
I hate tears. 
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Where's the old highway?
Sam.
Does that mean we can't...
Neither will I.
Watch your tenses.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Can you?
No.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
I'd like to.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Fine.
Yes.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
I didn't think so.
Do what?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
From what?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did I?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
I don't know--I can't tell--
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Maybe you're right.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
He isn't here.
How? What can I do?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
I'm losing my blood!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I don't agree with you.
You would.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Now don't that call for an extra!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Almost certain.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
You're insane.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Excuse me???
I'm heading out of town.
That's the physicist's playground.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Well, I got to see her.
Where is she?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
You won't die, Rose.
Okay.
Five hundred rabbits?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well, a little.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
But how would you find him?
Well... maybe...
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
I think Daddy suspects.
They're discussing it.
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing, Doll?
Is that all?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
No, son, she is dead.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I think we both know her.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
She will succeed.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
What time is it?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Fine.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
You mean a farm?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I remember it.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Be quiet, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
It'll get better now.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I don't mind.
You're not gonna see him again.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Now you know what to watch for...
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
I don't know.  Fuck off!
What... ?
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
That wasn't my fault.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
What?
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
No, but it should.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Nope.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There'll be other chances.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
Murderer?  Really?
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
Who is that... ?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
All right. Stand by.
I can't see.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
All set.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Hold me.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
You, too.
Good, I hate long waits.
All right, hang on.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
We shall double our efforts.
Red Leader standing by.
Here goes nothing.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Disintegrated?
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
I've got something to say.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
A decision had to be made.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
The delivery boy.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...I'm sorry.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
By accident?
I don't think I belong here.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
That so.
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
You're hurtin', man!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Fouls.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Why?
No dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Ten minutes.
How 'bout some Cokes?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
You have my food in ya hand.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Gonna try.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What'd you say?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Why?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Spider Rice.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ya puttin' me on?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Yo, Benny.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Fine... That guy's great.
See what?
Great, kid, great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Bullmastiff.
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Gazzo's a good man.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
He's a Toon... who cares?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
What the hell's a freeway?
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Eddie, come on.
That's what you woke me up for?
Sure, Valiant, sure...
That was the idea.
No, I don't.
Divorce?  Never!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Forget it.
From this box here...
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Ay me!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
NO! Mercutio!
What wouldst thou have with me?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Is that right?
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Which leads us to...
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Not yet...
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
There's a problem...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
A post office box.
It's done.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
There is one other thing...
Really?
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
My way is better.
Did he bring that with him?
To see a man about a thing.
That's what I thought.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
You were smoking?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
You don't have to do this.
It's my job.
Very ugly.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You think?
Right now?
Just like that?
Why not?
You better get some sleep, alright?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Seamus Reilly.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
None of them had any --
I want to get some hounds down here.
Sure thing, and --
Never heard of it.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Hell, it won't be us!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
What are you thinking?
I...I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
What are you thinking?
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
How much?
Just take it in stride.
What's that?
I might have to look into that...
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Are you sure you're OK?
I love you too.
You deserve it is the occasion.
And I'd take it out on him.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I don't know.  My friends...
Yeah.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
This just might be our ticket!
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Is this marked money, or what?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Hi.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Have I seen her?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, sir.
How much is that?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
So what's your story?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
I don't think so...
Lee, you okay?
That's right.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
How you doin'?
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm calling for back up!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
And you ain't black!
Good at what?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You said --
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What is it?
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Shhh, my head hurts.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
No.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Who's Benjamin?
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Yes.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
It's okay, I got lots more.
This money is evidence.
New York City?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
No.  But I'll help you.
The Secret Service?  Why?
You must come with me for questioning.
Yes, Master.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I know, but --
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
It was not my intent --
No.
Did you make the plate?!
Don't go there...
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, it's good.
Good God, ya'll!
It's him.
What?
You know him?
No...what?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Or somethin'.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Ambassador Han.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I still have work to do here.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
You bet ya, Coach.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Tootaloo.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
We'll see.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
Six-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Of course.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Missed me bad, huh?
Excuse me?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Good boy, Port Hole.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
That's good.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Happy New Year.
What is it?
What?
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
About what?
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
"I want to meet you..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
I know.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Is this crazy?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Any time.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
What?
What?
Sure you do --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Yeah.
I don't know --
Right, right.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
My feelings exactly.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I don't know.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Not now, Jonah --
It's only ten o'clock.
It's a short word.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
It might be in the kitchen.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
Sure.
You must be Jonah.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You could have called me --
No thanks.
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
It never ends.
The woman question?
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
No, Estellita.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Yes.
I've had them since the day they were born.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
No.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
The what!
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Shhh.
Not even a guess?
You like that?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Everything go?
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
Then leave.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
And you admire that?
I try.
Nothing.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Please open the door, Danny.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Guess it's our turn.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
You on a roll?
Can your man handle that?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Sure, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Hey, check it out...
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Understand what?
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
You go, boy.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
To who?
What?!
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
That would be me.
They have. But they never found a lab.
There's no motels around here.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
That is so unfair.
Why are you doing this?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
Figured.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Cap'n...?
Of course, sir.
Like hell, you did.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
White-walls?
Pass.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Simpson.
What about Talbot?
Maybe.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
You're kidding yourself.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Is it getting worse?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Yeah.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
There's always a bright side.
Ours is not to reason why.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Get back to your positions!
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Who knows?  It worked.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Understanding the following rights...
Good for her.
Excellent.
Hey, sis.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
That's just so embarrassing.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I am.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I dream about it.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I can accept that.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Okay.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah.  What a day.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Bye.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
What did you say?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Right.
This is so noble.
It was wonderful.
We decided...
No, I don't, I don't.
No.
Oh shit.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I know.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Man, you're bringing me down!
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Are you?
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
I know this part, keep reading.
What?
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Alright.  Key?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Alright!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Oskar, please -
I'm sorry to hear that.
You're kidding.
I pay you too much.
He's important to my business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I don't know.  Soon.
I just told you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Of course I'm on it.
Yeah, okay.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Yes.
Thank you.
More.
They're withholding payment.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
What is it?
Stop it...
That's smart.
Who is this?
Where is everybody?
I'm inquisitive.
I live here.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
You could start with an apology.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
You’re all in this together?
Enter Cotton Weary.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
The forbidden subject.
No, it's not.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Or it found us.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Meaning?
And Joel's pre-med.
Over here.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Don't worry...
Just in case...
Dewey, there's no such place.
Whatever.
It's what you want from me.
Are you in danger now?
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Hello?  Hello?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Gotta.
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
But she's standing right next to you.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
He's after me.
Don't panic.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Melinda McGraw?
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Hello.
I don't know.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Thanks.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Closer than you think.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Absolutely.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
The killer called her.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Need to get in that building?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Good twist.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Let's get out of here!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman that's not the line.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Yes.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Are you sure?
Who the fuck is this?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
You sleep in THAT?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
What?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Fuck you.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
To apologize.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
You're making popcorn?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
More of a game, really.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Sure...
That all depends on you.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Can I bring Kenny?
Sidney's father?
Hold up a sec...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Yeah.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
It'll be out later this year.
Just stay back.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
That's the original part.
Right here.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Who are you?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
The official term is "psychotic".
No way.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
I'm not worried.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Deal.
I don't know, they just did.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
Announcing what?
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
It's always been like this.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Where was the girl?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Hello.
You know that's not true.
Spit it out.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers like you?
It's close.
Shut up!
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Good.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
What?
Hello.
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
And, if it's a threat.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Okay.  But, what?
Bear with me.
Just wait!
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Oh, it's alright.
No.
Yes we do.  Here...
You got to be kidding.
We're focusing.
I'm fine.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I will.
Wait!
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
Too long.  What do you think so far?
It's a hard place.
Crime of passion.
What, Ben?
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Sir?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Grab hold!...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Ain't yours yet.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Leggo...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
What?
Cut it out, will ya...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
We won't be here...Come on!
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
I got your boy killed.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Finish your breakfast...
I got to fetch her home...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
It still worked in town.
Oh, damnit!
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
I just had a really strange experience.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
You don't remember?
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I've killed my husband!
Just call me Elisabeth.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Romeo
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
That's me.
Oh, that.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
it will be all right, madam.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
It is all locked safe in here
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
To my weekly confession.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
No, it will turn out well.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How will it?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
When the Queen commands it.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Stand up straight, girl.
Your Majesty
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
But the plague
I have to get back.
Who is there?
A lowly player.
Oh--I am him too!
Oh, not for the world!
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Mr. Henslowe?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I was the more deceived.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Orsino…good name
How does it?
I do not love you, my lord.
But why me?
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
Serve.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Come on, David.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
But not quite.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
About the mail --
Where do you think you'll go?
But there's no --
Well, then?
What?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's all?
Yes.
What?
Yes.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Well, yes.
Really?
Just serve.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
So I gathered.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
What? What's wrong?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
What?
OK.
Are you all right?
No, no, it's different.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
It's the only way.
Alex.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
No one. I promise.
I should hope so.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Would you like to see the rest?
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Did he sound upset?
It's an improvement.
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
And that's not the same thing?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Who?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
That's okay too.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Whatever you say.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Yeah.
I do her hair, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Am I what?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Great.
She is.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Yeah... I mean great.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
What?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Mmmm --
Not me, pal.
Lester's on his way.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's too late...
What for?
What?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Hey, stop by the shop.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
What're you talking about?
What's gonna happen?
What?
What!
Great.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Commercials.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Jesus.
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
What did you say?
Thank you.
They're not?
You're right.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
-- yeah?
Isn't that bad for it?
Well... who are those guys?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Okay, thanks.
Who?
Oh yeah...
No --
Yes I do.
I'll call you back...
What do you mean?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
You do?
I am?
Then you were talking to him.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie, what're you doing?
See you later.
I know, I'm sorry.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
He's a hairdresser.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
Jill.
No.
No.
Have they sat down?
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
Okay.
Do you feel bad?
Dad?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Yeah.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
What about Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
Oh!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Do I have to?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Grady... oh.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Sure.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Hmm, nice.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
How do you like it?
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Jack...
Why?
Wendy!
Wendy give me the bat.
Wendy...
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Not for me.
They'll love it.
Oh...
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Hi.
Eight thirty.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
What?
What kind of noises?
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
What if it's some kind of monster?
Do I need one?
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
You know what we're saying!
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
You can handle this.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Yes?
Good evening, Vincent.
Joey -- do it.
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Yes, Betty?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
I know.  It's ancient.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
That man -- who is he?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
I knew that.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Five a.m.?
I... I...
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
A novice.
What?
Now you.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Your name?
Very well.
What?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that?
Can do.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
A what?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
My what?
And whom would you call?
Come, Sister.
What?
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
But...
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Me too.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Even nuns have to pee.
They open a window.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Who are you guys?
It didn't happen.
Yeah...
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Neither did you!
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
That should have tipped us.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
But where?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Find 'em!
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
A diseased monster.
What of it?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
Not for lack of trying.
Believe?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
We should go.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
What does it mean?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Lady Van Tassel...
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
It was not butchery.
What troubles you?
What?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
I do not know.  Away.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
I can show exactly.
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What numbers do you punch?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol' boy.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
I reckon.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
You will? For sure?
No sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
I'm glad of it, honey.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Did Vaughan go home?
I love you, too, Mama.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I ain't got no boy.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
I didn't aim to.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon not.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Can I help you, sir?
Do you smell shit?
Why won't he talk to women?
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
It's my birthday.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Not a peep.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
You got it.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
You're looking good, Auggie.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Why don't you open it and find out?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And these?
I think I'll take them. 
Thanks for the tip.
How the hell did you get into the building?
You mean Rashid?
And his parents?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And you told your nephew about it?
And?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Not a one.
What's your offer?
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You can't be more specific than that?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
How long have you been here?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I don't have much time. 
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
I just did.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Here, catch.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yes, please.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Why not?
Well, it seems to me...
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
And the last...?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Carl Heine came.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Apparently.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Obviously.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Not in those words.
Carl never lied.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
They got the bull-fiddle.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Fight it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I got pinched in the elevator.
And I'm not even pretty.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
But this is so humiliating.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Have I got things to tell you!
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
You got some?
I'm fine.
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
What's that?
I guess she's not in here.
Well, I'll come back later.
I hope so.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
What's the big idea?
You're not sure?
I'm not surprised.
Wanna bet?
I'll throw up!
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Why?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
My car?  Why, you -
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Where did he conduct?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Good night, Sugar.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
Well, I'm not.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
They repealed Prohibition?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
I don't mind if I do.
Bon voyage.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
What happened?
Talk about sad.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Good morning.
From a rich millionaire.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
I knew you would.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
I know.  Every time!
Coffee?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Goodbye, Charlie.
What for?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
And you do now?
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
I have regrets.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
I slept with your sister.
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
Love.
I don’t know.
I think that’s disgusting.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
What?!
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Will do.
You don't live around here, do you?
Is he here in Borderdale?
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
That's right--
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Yes mam...
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
David!
I don't look like no possum!
That's right!
Yes mam...
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Yes, mam...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Is there something I can do to help you?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
My head hurts.
Doggy.
Very funny!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
What Cartman?!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Okay.    Not.
Yes, hon?
Help yourself prickfuck!
Eric?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Uhh...
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Uhh... Bacon.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Kyle, check it out.
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah...
How do we do that?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
-Or monkey fucker-
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Yes?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Oh.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Canada is saving us!!
I am.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
What's the matter, Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
He's shutting off the air!!!
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
You're Warren Wayne.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I know, I know.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
You're right.
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
Yeah?
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
I'll do my best.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Talk to him...Jesus...
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
What kind of man?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
When you get a chance.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
La da da dalala...
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
I'd buy it!
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I never saw you.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
Hello, mom?
Cool!
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Who's there?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
What ever happened to just bowling?
How Mr. Kastle?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Look who's talking!
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Whips...orange whips.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Nothing.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Sheila, please.
More than you could afford.
...lane six. Yes.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
It's Junior, isn't it.
We would have sooner or later.
I feel sick.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
I said back away.
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
How long will that be?
But she's --
Forty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
What team?
They didn't tell me anything.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Hold on --
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Take a look.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
They've left, keep watching!
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
A break for what?
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
What do you make of this?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Underwater?
It never occurred to me.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Get this thing off me.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
My gosh, Norman.
What?
Beth --
Beth.
What are they?
So what?
In case you die, too?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
You think?
What?
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
But why is he doing it?
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How long does it last?
How's Harry?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
I --
Beth --
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It's an American spacecraft.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
We can refuse to talk.
Then what, Norman?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
You don't understand about the sphere.
What is it, Harry?
What are they?
What happened to her?
You know what it is, Harry.
Shut up and open the door.
I'm trying.  There.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Huh?
You mean you don't know?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
I'm not sure.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
This isn't a game, you know.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Not bad.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
Is that good or bad?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I know that.
What do you mean?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
That's where my father was killed.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
You mean we should go after her!...
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Why didn't you say so before.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
I read you sir.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
You got it bad.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Only when I give you an order.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So who's got time to get married ?
I don't know, Zander.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Carl can wait.
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
How are you, Carl ?
See you on the bounce !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
I'm on it !
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Uh, no.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Good for you. Go find out.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir.
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I'm aware of that, sir.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's taken control of the computer...!
Captain... I'd like to go along...
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Twelve seconds...!
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
The point... 
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
I'll be there.
Sure plan to.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Who?
What's it called?
It's in your play.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...I always thought so...
I love your script.
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Go you Huskies!
Gosh, you look nice.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Yes...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
I saw...
But that's what happened.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Who is this person that you've found?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Courthouse back in town.
Hi.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
This horse is booked.
I <u>know</u> my lines...
It's...
I'm having dinner with W...
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Joe, the writer?
Mr. Barrenger.
I wasn't in the car.
But we...
I just...
...yes...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I'm only trying to...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
What is the...?
Later for you, pal.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
My wife just went into labor...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
The writer.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Why?
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I'm gonna nail it.
You want me to lie.
I have to tell the truth.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
I don't...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
They're coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Sherry, Sherry...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...it is?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Givvem a cigarette...
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
I live.  In the same country.
Like a big sister.
I bet.
Secret's safe with me.
Great.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Oh, yeh.
Yes.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
That's so weak.
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
There's worse things.
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Yes.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
You have the WORST flu since...
Is your bad?
How do you know?
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
You dying.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
WE are over.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Look, I...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
She was angry at herself.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Don't flatter yourself.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Is that what he told you?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Give 'em my number.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Aw.
Worked.  Like a charm.
Oh please.
Double.
No, there isn't.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Rache, it may take time.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
Oh.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
This is work.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
My baby.
Jesus was not bad.
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
You mean, again?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Tired of this shit...
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Gee, you're home early!
Well, now you have.
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Three.
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah. I know.
No, thanks.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Y-yes--
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Who's got matches?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
What do you think?
Well Cooper...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
He's in there...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Moffo!
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes, of course.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Oh, yes, that's right.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
General Schmuck?
What did you say, sir?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Yes?
That's right, sir.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I presume the planes are armed?
Why can't you cancel it?
Admiral Buldike?
They're coming in now.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Maybe it's an exercise.
War?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Call them every five miles.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Some kind of signaling.
Forget it.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
He's dead.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Sorry, King.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Was it okay?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Typical male.
What's it about?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Right now?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Sorry.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
No, no.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
You know?
She's dead.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No, no, no.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Come on.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
I'm so burnt-out.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
This is private property, my friend.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Okay.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Mm.
It's a mistake to think that.
I'm not a nice guy.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
We were?
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Pony and I are friends.
It does look good.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Because I'm alienated.
No.
What?
Just put it down.
Look, your trespassing.
I don't know.
It's a piece.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Yeah.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Is that a threat?
Shit, Jeff!
Well, what about us?
Oh, fuck it, man!
What?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
So how's college?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
That was so great!
Mine too.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
I think I gotta go.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Whatever.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Y'think?
Mmm-hmmm...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
We're here for you, Diane.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Bullets.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
You're kidding.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Definitely old.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Bank branch!
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Close, but no cigar.
I'll take it.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Thanks.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You'll be waiting for me?
You did?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Well, for heaven's sake!
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'll make it short.
Nobody can be that busy.
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Whose?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It is not.  Get out.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
They'll love it in Pomona.
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Okay.
I've lost my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Come here!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Who?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
This is the right day.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Go on in.
Wipe your feet!
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Is that So?
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
All right.  Camera!  Action!
But where?
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Softball.
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Why not ?
What do you feel about me?
What's that?
Terrific.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Just like that?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
A passionfruit smoothee.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Can I quote you?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You're supposed to guess.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
It doesn't seem right.
I'd love to.
What? Me?
Throw him out.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I know.
Criminals.
Then come with me.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Who?
Oh...I came close once.
You thought that?
Old ties are hard to cut.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
We get together sometimes.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
First paycheck?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Decaffeinated too?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
What are you talking about, fella?
KRYPTONITE!
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
You designed it?
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Just a second.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
And do what?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
We've already met.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Where's the handle?
Missing????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Storms! Floods!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
We already have a super-tanker.
A normal person.
We can get to work on that oil!
Don't bet on it!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Say you love me.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Good. My heart can't take it.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Sentimental idiot.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'm sorry.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
An angle?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
There!
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
What do you fear?
Destiny.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
He's thirty-five years old.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Albert!
One of them should've been you.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Oh.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
La de da da...
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Lex is going bye-bye.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
All of us.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Thirty-five.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
It is for me.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Are you still in touch?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
She didn't.
That's okay.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Alison.
I'll tell her that.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Billy, please.  The children.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
A while.
When the game's over, I guess.
Why?
Yes.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
I didn't say that.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
No.  A little sugar though.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
It's interesting.
I feel like a princess.
It's the truth.
That's what he said.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
You hate that.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
No.
Almost three.
So what's the problem?
Yes.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Do you have this agreement with you?
No.
Any criminal record?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
And where did you sit that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Why were you scared?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
You mean it?
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Alone or surrounded?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Give me a chance --
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
No.  I'm going home.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
I don't?
Are you finished?
When?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Can't hurt...
But not for anything I did today...
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Hello.
What kind of an act is this?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I'm used to you...
Take a top coat.
That's no way to talk...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Why not you?
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Like you?
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
If the stores are open -
Why did you call me?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Liquid metal.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
You told me to.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
Smile?
Yes.  Throw it in.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Unknown.
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
Please continue...
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Five minutes.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
I have a duty.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I was warned.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
No!
Tell me about von der Null.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
So. You wanted to see me.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yeah?
One of my people?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Who's he?
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
You're late.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Right.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Kyle.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Why?
What about it?
You must have had a fun child-
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
You're not supposed to.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I can't sleep.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
Oh, no... you.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
A game?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
It was a gift... from my brother.
Why not?
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
I think not.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I thought...
Wha... ?
Get out of my car!
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
What... what do you mean?
Who's responsible?!
Fuck you.
Shut up!
I have to show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Fun?
I'll call them, okay?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
No, thank you.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
Like, this way... sort of...
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
The key?
I'm not sure.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Did you worry about him?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Why are you following me?
Don't ask.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Sam...  Thank you.
Well, I... uh...
Who's Watts?
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
There's a carriage house around back.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You could have.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
All night?
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
No one will come any nearer than that.
I don't know what you mean.
I know.
You're okay.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
No, it's getting worse.
I don't know what to think anymore.
-- What do you think?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Just had to be sure.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
What kind of food?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Sure.
We all did.
I'm a gracious host.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think?
Come over here.
Okay.
There's been some trouble downtown.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Hard to miss.
Not her brand.
Try calling me again.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
He give me your address.
Something like that, yeah.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
My employer.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
The forever kind.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Something's on.
You bet.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
No trouble.
Susan.
You know I don't live with him.
Ah.
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Be seein' you.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
He didn't say that.
Huh.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Huh.
No. I--tell me--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Way out of line.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Mm.
Come on in.
So you paid the guy?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
You don't have to tell me anything.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Walter.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
Where's the walk-in safe?
Hurry up!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
What doors?
Like hell!
What's left of it.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
I know.
All right everybody, hold up!
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I don't believe it.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Look who's here, Margo.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
I don't believe it.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
What is it?
Like this.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
He's right.  Follow me.
Quiet.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Frock's been fired.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
How about lunch?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
I think... it means it's full.
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
I have to shoot.
I can't!
Why wouldn't I?
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Shhh!
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Oh, yes.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Now.
So when are you leaving?
You think so?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
How about them?
I told you I can't.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Gee, that's great.
I've been thinking--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I made macaroni.
What?!
You blaming me for the traffic?
I bet you did.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
There's no one here.
Does what?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Show you right on a map.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
I know the name. Why?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
You can't.
What did it look like?
What's wrong, Scully?
What happened to playing a hunch?
How's that?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
All I told them was the truth.
No.
I was until about an hour ago.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Very weird.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
General McAddie's.
I don't know anything about that.
About the conspiracy?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
No.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Why did we stop?
He needs to be turned over.
I'll be fine.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Peter, okay?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
I got it.
's broken.
I need you to find something in the basement...
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
I'll get her...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Dr. Kent.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
It's his dog.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Ja, ja, ja.
Give her some cigarettes.
They think you did it.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
We're both in it, Harry.
Yes.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
Why?
Oh...
I shall be all right.
Oh, the usual things...
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Thank you.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
There's nothing in them.
I have never seen him.
I don't know.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
Just around the corner.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Yes.
Once in a while.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
It wasn't petrol.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
In Vienna...
Bring him in.
I'm not asking you to.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
She's right. It's none of my business.
I said you win.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I know a very good dentist.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Of course, of course, of course.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
It's good to see you, Holly.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Coffee.
But you will.
How do you do.
Yes.
I understand...
In great pain?
English?
Must be some mistake.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Yes.
Now, hold on.
Well make it your business.
I am not a bad man.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Just take it, OK.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Thanks.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
Good morning.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
We're ok.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
No.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
That's stupid. Why would they?
You can't.
No.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
V'asitem...
No difference.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Do they?
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
And be crushed.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
What about Curtis Zampf?
Notice? Like what...?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
No.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
From the Rhineland originally.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Steve...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Who told you that?
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Why? Why would she?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
Dennis Leary.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Yes.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
The documents are forged.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Italian is practically the same thing.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Italy!
Okay.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Don't.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
What does that mean?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
No...
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
... For the mermaids.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
... I was right about what?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Who?
We saw each other a little while ago.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
I don't know... why?
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
I got fired.
I'm still here.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
No... tell me.
It's me again.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
I saw how it has to be.
He doesn't hear too well.
Louis, we were French!
... Sally?
Again?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Why is he doing this?
... Yes?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Sure. Why not.
Keep going.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Mazel Tov!
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
No. I'm serious about this.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Tomorrow -—
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
That's right, of course.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
No.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
You. Us.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
You a tourist?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
When will they be back?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
No!
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
You splendid bastard...
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
Can you tell me how you spell...
Croissants.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
I’m fine standing, thank you.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
I know where to look.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Emily...
Have we done business before?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
What kids?
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
B-Black...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
La what?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Recommended?
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
When... I’m told he came here...
Jah...
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
How are you, Rhian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Good reasons?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
Er... Yes...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
I... How long have I been here?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
I know his work better than I know him.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Cinq cents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Fuck...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Of course I am, it's just that...
So... pretend it's not a game.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Jeanne, no...
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
But... why... what's the point?
I want to stay with you...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
I don't remember.  Maybe.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Praying.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Silence her!  Take her away...!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
I understand.  How much?
You think?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
You did well...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Damn right!
Me too...
But the bridge has been pulled down!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
No...
That's now what I meant...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Don't swear...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Playing...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I might ask you the same question.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
In His name??
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
I need to confess.
Whose were they?
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
And what does he say to you?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Who wants me to stop?
Yes.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Oh, yes. I remember.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
He'll be here soon.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
I'll be fine.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Yes, please.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
There are always notices going up.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Wladek! How are you?
You're a dirty pig!
Sorry, I don't remember.
Not yet.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Yes, it's unholy.
I'll be back.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
I'd like to make a swap.
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
I don't want to learn.
No.
They are washed.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Shove off, Duff.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Which one?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Who's got the contract?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
Neither are we.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
I also gotta win.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
He'd like to kill me.
You move right along, don't ya.
Okay, Tootsie.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Let me talk to him.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
How am I gonna do that?
Don't think I know him.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
For fifteen years.
Is that what it means?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Another young man.
Go!
Do you think I care
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't.
Hello, there!
Disappeared!
Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?
It's a promise?
Not a thing.
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Nunheim!
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
I'll take care of him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
He did!
I see.
No.
Goodbye.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
What did you do with the rest?
But suppose some business comes up...
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Santa Claus.
We need ice.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Yes.
That's jolly.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Breakfast.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Someone get a doctor.
Your guess is as good as mine.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
He was down in the shop.
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Mimi...
I don't know.
No... no.
I know I left them there.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
Yeah.
Ready when you are.
Maybe we should split it up now.
Then get up and do something about it.
Why'd he come in our camp.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You said he was a deserter.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
What are you doing?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Oh, that's fun.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
I heard it click.
I heard it.
We're going to be right over here.
Epps...
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing here?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Something like that.
Stay low.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
I don't know.
What?
Okay.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
I could.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Oh, no.
How the hell should I know how much?
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Correct.  Origin?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Looks like dirt.
What?
No one can see us now we're alone.
What?
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Why are you so concerned?
Look!
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
I don't care.
No?
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
I thought of something.....
You should know better than that!
Where are they?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Anything else I should know?
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
`Til we get a better lead.
Be right back.
Right.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Easy, guys.  
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
"Punks", huh?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Nothing so far.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
It's about this.
IRA - instant retirement account.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
That feeling won't last long.
Report on the case so far.
I know.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Diamonds all over.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Very well, Jacques.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
erect in sweater, arms folded.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
What is it?
What do you mean?
I know it!
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Gaston Monescu.
What?
Certainly!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
No. What is it? Tell me.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Ye-es?
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Um-hum ...
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
I know all your tricks.
You're conceited--
No--thirty-five! 
Call the police?
And you expect me to believe that?
Giron...!
But it could have been glorious.
Well, he was in the navy.
The ship will sink.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
No, but we're making excellent time.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
A mistake?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
It's okay. I'm alright.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Get in the boat, Rose.
I'm so cold.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
You had it the entire time?!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date. 
We'll save you a place at our table.
Montana?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Sure!  Excuse me.
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Well, I can't.
At seven-thirty?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Sorry.
Sally--!
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Good night, idiot!
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
You can live that down, can't you?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Are you screwy?
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
You take some awful chances.
I'll take one. 
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's a pleasure.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
What's that?
Sure.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Send that.
Next month is June.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Are you happy?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Somebody's got to do it--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Eh?... Oh.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Telegrams.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Beauty, ain't he?
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Well... 'bye.
Excuse me?
But wait, you don't understand-
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
But who was the Devil?
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Then what do I do?
All right.  Then what?
Not half as bad as I feel.
I don't.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Wyatt...
Wait!
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Forget it, Ringo.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Drop his horse.
Morg, use your head.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Sure...
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
What about the gold?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Well... If you insist.
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Three. You? Married?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Let's not make it a habit.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
- You're not.
What?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
What do you mean?
Now.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Sabotage?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
My timing always was lousy.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Who is it?
Will the cruise set it off?
Since when?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Junior spends time with his child.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Like a veil has been lifted?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What for?
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
It is just a regular card.
No, I'm too hot now.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
I'll be right there.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Good afternoon to you.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Oh, yeah!
No, I haven't seen him.
Where was the last place you left him?
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
But what if we leave them behind?
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
No, you can't.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
But why would Andy want me?
What?!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
She's sick!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Alright!  That's it!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Nothing.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Last present!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!

That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Speed up!
I did like the music.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
She got away.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
All the time.
So had I.
Storms?
Victoria -
I can't find Manolo.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Arnie, this is crazy.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Me, too.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
So's the video camera.
What do you think?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
I get A's.  All A's.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Depends on the state.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Yeah.
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I feel like a traitor.
If I can.
Everybody has a weakness.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
You've stabbed me, man.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Diane.
Eh-
Ssshh!
Are you clean?
Smells like it.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Nightmare.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
What do you mean?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Well, it's up to you.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your usual table, sir?
In that case --
As you wish.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Six weeks.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Went ballistic?
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
He doubts me.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Plotting our new course.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Oh, please.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
That's a little vague, Spock -
Hmmm?
It must be all those marsh melons.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Am I? We'll see.
Because you, too, must know.



"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
He's not?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
No. You must kill me.
No. I will not.
Do you?
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
To warn him.
That Dillinger's on to him.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
For sure...
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
The Pentagon?
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Probably.
Shhhhh.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You're getting out of the business?
Strategic Air Command.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I'm shocked.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Fine.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
What?
What?
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
The purse is still at the house.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Sorry.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes, sir.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Is that why you got into this business?
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
He needed my help.
Sure, hon.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
You wouldn't believe me.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
And you've got one.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
What is it you need me to do?
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
I just glances inside.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Wait a minute -
He wants to speak with you.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
The letter he sent.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Now hang up.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What time is it?
There's nothing to tell.
What do you do?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You didn't do nothing.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Thank you.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Cancoon.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Good for you.
Every word of it.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I certainly hope so.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Where?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
No.
No. No you're not.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
We grew up together.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Sure. No problem.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Underground.
July?!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
James, why don't we...?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
What's the matter with your leg?
You have to give yourself up, you know.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
You're sure?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
It's private.
I'm here about some monkeys.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
He's been tested for drugs?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
I need a ticket.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
Hundred-fifty.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What?
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
You got beer?
Yeah, I'll try.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
The wind isn't blowing.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have ideas.
Still playing?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
No.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Yeah.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I wanted to talk.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Where are you going?
Now what?
But I want to say with you,
I think I busted my leg.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I'm her husband.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
How do you know if you've never tried?
No.
About what you said this morning.
I do.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Come on, Jake--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
You're too quick for me.
Will you shut up!
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
What happened?
I guess.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I don't understand what the--
What for?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
That's a solid name.
Bobby Cooper.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Like you don't know.
Would I what?
I do.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You're too quick for me.
How old are you?
So?
How much!?
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I want my car.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I have an idea.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
How do you know he's still not here?
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could leave him.
Walk away.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Anywhere?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Where to?
How much?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
There's someone in the house.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I want my lawyer!
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Do you remember me getting sick?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Rust?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Is there a problem?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
No.
No.
Two hundred and seventy.
That's great.
Is David Dunne there?
No.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I fined 'em instead.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Innocent of what?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
You ain't dead.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Your wife?
She back in Kansas?
Shit and fried eggs.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well, how about it?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
Huh?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Best we move that pig.
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Who said that?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
You gonna share your half with him?
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
He's blind, for Chri...
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Alright.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
Then who goes?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Dig.
Can we stealth these guys?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
If you'll just let me -
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Tough break.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
You're lying.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Business or personal?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
Which is shit.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
What?
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
I'm not a rat.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Kobayashi.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
But Keaton...
Edie.
Because he was my friend.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You think he's..?
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Abrams...
Very good.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
What does it mean?
I was her doctor.
Yes.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
You may step down.
It's a crime.
Yes.
I . . ..
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
... that's all right.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...What difference would...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Kathy Price.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
And what are you?  A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Maybe what?
Is there going to be a later...?
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
Right.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
I'm swell.
...one of the other nurses?
The 'History'...?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
How old is he?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
Thanks, Franky.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Should I?
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
Then?
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
And when she goes to those places...
Did she hurt herself?
What for? Who are you?
Why?
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Why?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Don't go.
No.
Honest?
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Oh, yeah. There.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
You like it, too.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Madeleine!
The tall trees...
Yes...
No!
Yesterday.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I'm here, I've got you...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
You can't.
I won't lose you.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
Uh-huh!
Normal.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Who?
Do you know him well?
I'll take you home.
You haven't told me everything.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Did you need it?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
By whom?
Can we have it by tonight?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What?
What did you say?
The hell you do.
You're a loser.
You go home!
I'm not getting a ticket.
What?
What are you talking about?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
At the seven-eleven.
I don't give a damn.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know...
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Don't sweet lip me.
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Here's his head.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
I think we should say some words over the grave.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
He's having a problem here.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
What did you ask me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Now?
You need help.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What? What's your point?
You said nobody would miss her.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Goosed!
What?
I think so.
Sent it.
Right before the wedding?
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What kind of seats can we have?
What are you doing?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Are they fighting?
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
Yeah. You.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
The prostitute.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What money?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
I just want her to be happy.
I don't hear it.
How do you know she's dead.
I got to agree with that.
A move?
Greenpeace?
Did he try to kiss you?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
That's our plan.
Drum banging real times.
Yes, yes.
Two.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Yes, sir. Good night.
What's the matter?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Leave him alone.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
What's he called?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Where?
Very, very?
But, miss ...
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I had so many things to think about!
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Me? What did I do?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I've seen worse.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'M WHAT?!
He hears...everything.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
I've been in prison, remember?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Enjoying yourself?
I'm doing the best I can!
Both.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.

You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
...twelve years.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
And you?
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
I'll see you at National.
Who would find out?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Eight Days To Go 
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Anything at the Airport?
<u>So</u> forth...
Gloria -- sell the House.  
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?

I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
When's he coming back...?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Is that true?

It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?

Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
I saw it on TV.
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
Big mistake.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Of what?
...givem what they want...But...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's too clean.
...what is this?
Why are they ...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Yes.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Yes. 
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Show some compassion.
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Please, no thanks... 
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Get the hell out!
Start unloading.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
You speak for me, son.
What are you doing here?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
He never told me...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
What? How do you know about my father?
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
What does that mean?
...I can't make it tonight.
Dump it.
Gordon.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Well, why stop at that?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
...how do you know? You wish...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's over you, Gordon.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Yeah, yeah, OK
So why are you dating Jonathan?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Ok toots, I will.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
No?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
What?  Tony and China, together?
That's not what you said last night.
A little?
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Safety in numbers man.
Right behind you.
Well divide 18 into three
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
You guys are being real assholes
Your husband?
Do you really think so?
You're joking.
Well, that's what we're here for.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
I don't know.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
This fence...it's so...
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
She never mentioned her father.
I don't know.
This is...
...just so she could cut them off.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Yep.
What?
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Jody, wait.
Did I?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
If she was dangerous before--
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I think three...
Nice.  Almost done.
Fine.
Not the focus.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What's going on, Claire?
What?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...Don't get all...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Harvey says he's amazing.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
But I don't remember.
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
STOP IT!
So you fucked a student?!
Get out of my way.
How did she know where it was?
She can't be here without me.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Huh.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
But why would they do that...?
Michael, Rowan should -
What are you talk---
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Better than most, I suppose.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Anybody got a BP yet...?
If you knew how I yearn for that...
I bring her flowers too.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I LOVE him!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
The one time I want it to work...
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
Really...?  Your family there...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
- a witch.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Hello..
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
That's cause we're below sea level.
- we made a fire.
Your beneficence.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Go ahead.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You can't just -
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That's right...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Yes, one and a half please.
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Did you?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Then make it stop...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
At 2.00...
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Get out...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Oh...
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
These are real, live women?
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Yeah?
Yeah?
So you'll think about it?
So that's a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
You have changed since second grade.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Of course we are.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
That's me.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hmmm?
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
My room?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I meant biologically.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I didn't forget.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Your article sucked.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
He didn't. He had it built.
It's incredibly simple.
Eventually you'll let go.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
I'm very aural.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Maybe someday.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
You better.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
But how would we pay our bills?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
People pay good money for that?
It's about your parents.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
And where might that be?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Take your time.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Where's this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
You didn't cuff her?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
What?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What brain?
No you don't.
In back of the garage.
About six and a half million dollars.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Duquette.  Forget him...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
Just like that?
I did.  At Blue Balls.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Will they?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Aha?
What about the explosive?
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
I adjusted it.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
Thank you.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
In the next two minutes?
You tell me.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Would that include me?
Private train?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nicely said, sir.
And?
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
That would be... the Mexican War?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Just get me some horses.
Let's go.
Not today, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Let me see it.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I will!  But I need help!
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Absolutely!
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Where the hell did you come from?
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
I won't.
Who?
No!
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Burn it to a fine ash.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
His will.
Who is he?
Who??
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How are we going to get out there?
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
They're Amish.
Pretty much.
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Yeah.
Johnny –
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Only the elders.
But you can't.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
I know.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I didn't even know about it.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
His name is John Book.
No...
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
That is idle talk.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
They don't have any shit.
You might have killed him!
My son is out there!
No... No. It is just the English way.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
If she...
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Hickory!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Whenever you wish.
Why --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh --!
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh! Oh!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
The nerve.
Hah!
Not nobody, not nohow!
But why?  Why?
Huh?  What'd he say?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh --
Here -- here --
Oh --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Leave her alone!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It's too late!  There they....
Don't you start it, too!
Who at?
What's the matter?
Fine.  He's got a plan
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Hold still - hold still --
Yeah --
Don't push!
Not nohow!
Ohhhhhh!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Hurry -- hurry --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Go on!
You promised us real things -- a real...
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
Perhaps after this ... test?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
I took the initiative.
Renard.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The worm on the hook again.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
No.
We’re alright.
I know.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
A rope!
What class sub does your nephew run?
Please.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Washington?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
God isn't there to do it.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Because --
Jon -- what??
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What if you¹re wrong??
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Antarctica??
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
That's because --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Coward.  Giving up.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
-- What?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Am I free to go?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Ever see one of these before?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Looks like a diner.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Who says you're the good guys?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
The scum of the Earth.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Naturally.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Go to hell.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
They come in any other styles or colors?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm through, Xander.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
Its core?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
We have to find Magneto.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
What's that?
Into the Hudson?
I wanted to talk to you.
Sure you are, sport.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
By reading my thoughts?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
Suit yourself.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
How?
What do you want with him?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I know.
It does indeed, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
MMmmm.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Yes!... the laboratory.
May I have it, please?
I beg your pardon?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
No, Fred ereck.
You must be Igor.
I'm sure we will.
Why are you talking like that?
What wockers?
Wockers with the knockers???
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
All right... elevate me!
Tonight?
This guy means business.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Who are you talking to?
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
I'm not trying to be funny.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What???
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think so.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I see what you mean.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
But will they make good use of them?
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
